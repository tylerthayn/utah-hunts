It will provide access to Minnie Maud Canyon, lower Argyle Canyon, Harmon Canyon, as well as Cottonwood and Cedar Ridges.  The Bruin Point road is accessed via SR123 in the town of Sunnyside.  This road is impassible during the winter months.",

			"COUNTY_ROAD_INFO": "All roads and ATV trails on this unit are managed by the BLM and are covered on their Travel Management Plans.  Most major roads are maintained by Carbon, Emery, and Duchesne Counties.  The Bruin Point dugway and Cottonwood Canyon dugway are both very steep and should not be attempted if there is a bunch of snow without tire chains.  Pulling a camper trailer up the Bruin Point Dugway is possible but difficult.  Please direct all questions regarding which roads and trails ATVs can be operated on to the Price BLM office at <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/price.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/price.html</a>",

			"PRIV_TRIBE_LAND_ISSUES": "The hunt unit does not include Ute Tribal lands as shown on the hunt boundary map on the Division's website.  There are several access roads across Tribal Lands in the Anthro Mountain area, for information on which roads are legal access roads contact Duchesne County.  All ATVs are prohibited on Tribal Lands, they must be trailered on access roads across Tribal Lands.\n\nThis unit has a high percentage of private property on high elevation summer habitat, much of this property is managed as  CWMU’s. All private land requires written permission before hunting.  On this unit it is absolutely essential to have a map showing land ownership prior to hunting as most public land parcels are small and isolated and often surrounded by posted private property.  A GPS unit is also very handy.  \n",
