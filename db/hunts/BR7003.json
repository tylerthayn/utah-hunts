			"SAFETY_CONS": "High elevation habitat will still have winter-like conditions during much of the duration of this hunt.  Cell coverage is very limited while hunting the canyons where bears reside.  Most roads will often be muddy.  Four-Wheel drive vehicles are necessary and many of these roads. Be prepared with tire chains and all of the equipment necessary to get your vehicle unstuck. ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Bears can be found across the unit at any elevation.  However, most hunters find success during the spring hunt in the mid-elevation canyons around the unit.  Typically bears move down in elevation a bit to den for the winter.  Upon emerging from the den, bears often stay at these elevations for a time and follow the greenup of vegetation up the mountain as springtime progresses.  The upper portions of the mountain typically have very little access in April and early May due to persisting snowpack and snowdrifts in many of the roads.  Most hunters have success in the major canyons between elevations of 6500 and 8500 feet.  Although there are large blocks of private land on the northeast portion of the unit, many landowners are much more amenable to allowing public hunting access for bear hunters than they are for big game hunters.  It doesn't hurt to do some research and ask for permission.  ",
