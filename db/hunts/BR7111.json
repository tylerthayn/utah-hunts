			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt is meant to target black bears that are up higher in elevation during the spring hunt and inaccessible to hunters due to road closures during that season.  Hunters should pick bait locations that won't interfere with campers or put people at risk.  Oftentimes, multiple bears will come into the bait stations and hunters need to know how to tell the sex of the bear and make sure sows don't have cubs with them.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return if you camp out.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.<br>\n<br>\nBears can be unpredictable and caution should be taken when hunting them.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for snow, rain, wind, heat, and lightning.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Roads can become very muddy, and sometimes impassable, after spring storms.",
