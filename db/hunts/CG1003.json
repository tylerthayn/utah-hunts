			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a Harvest Objective hunt unit.   This unit encompasses aspen, open sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and desert scrub.  Hunters can expect to see cougars on private land within the unit.  Hunters should receive written permission from private landowners prior to the start of the hunt if they wish to hunt private property.   This unit is part of a cooperative interstate hunt agreement and allows hunters to hunt on the Nevada portion of the unit.  Likewise, Nevada hunters can hunt on the Utah side.\n<br>\nMost roads and ATV trails on this unit are managed by Box Elder County or BLM and are covered on their Travel Management Plans.  Please direct all questions regarding which roads and trails ATVs can be operated on to the BLM.\n<br>\nBLM: <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/salt_lake.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/salt_lake.html</a>\n<br>\nBox Elder County:   <a href=\"http://www.boxeldercounty.org/box-elder-county-web-map.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.boxeldercounty.org/box-elder-county-web-map.htm</a>\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.  Services are available in Grouse Creek,  Montello, Nevada, or Wendover, Utah/Nevada.  Higher elevations of Pilot Mtn are extremely steep and rugged providing ample escape terrain for cougars.  Use caution when accessing these areas.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area at higher elevations.  At lower elevations, most years the snow will either melt off or blow away within a day or two until through the first week of December. ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Cougars in this unit move back and forth across the Nevada and Utah state lines, but an interstate hunt agreement exists allowing Utah hunters to hunt Nevada's unit.  Cougars are found throughout much of the unit, but are concentrated up Bettridge Canyon, Patterson Pass, and Governor's Spring near other wildlife.  Success improves if hunters can be on the mountain after any fresh snowfall.  Higher elevations of Pilot Mtn are extremely steep and rugged providing ample escape terrain for cougars.  Use caution when accessing these areas.",

Before you begin a hunting trip to a harvest objective unit, you must visit the Cougar Harvest Objective Page to verify that a unit is still open. The website will be updated each day by noon MST. Updates become effective the following day, 30 minutes before official sunrise. Effective for the 2021-22 season, there will no longer be a phone line available to check for open units.",
		"HARVEST_REPORTING": "<b>Required:</b> Any harvested cougar must be checked by a DWR employee within 48 hours of the date of kill. The DWR employee will affix a permanent possession tag to the pelt or unskinned carcass. You may not possess an unskinned carcass or green pelt after the 48 hour check-in period. If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",
