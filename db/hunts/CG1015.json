The Cottonwood area north of St. George around the south west side to the Pine Valley Mountain to Central is a high concentration deer winter range area with decent access.  The Beaver Dam Mountains from Highway 91 north to Jackson Wash is also a high concentration deer winter range which should hold a number of cougars.",

The DWR employee will affix a permanent possession tag to the pelt or unskinned carcass. You may not possess an unskinned carcass or green pelt after the 48 hour check-in period. If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",
