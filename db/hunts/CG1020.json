			"SAFETY_CONS": "Hunters should be prepared with extra gas and water this unit is remote and there are no services available.  This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Snow conditions on this unit can be spotty and is seldom a factor for access.  You may not be able to make it over a pass but with multilple access points around the unit you can access most places.  Some years are very dry and finding a track can be difficult.",

If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",
