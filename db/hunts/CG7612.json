The south end of the mountain can be accessed with the Pole canyon road (#072) near Angle or the Monroe Mountain road (#068) near Kingston. Both of these are maintained but are rather narrow and not recommended for large trailers. To access the west side of the unit use the Dry Creek road (#071) or the Monroe Canyon road (#078).
