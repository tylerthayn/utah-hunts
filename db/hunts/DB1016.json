			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is comprised primarily of sagebrush in the lower elevations, transitioning into juniper woodlands. The higher elevations have serviceberry, snowberry and bitterbush, with pockets of chokecherry, aspen and conifer. This unit is primarily the Sheeprock and Simpson Mts. This area is very accessible, with many dirt roads. Spend some time in the area to become familiar with the steep terrain, access points and the quality of bucks.  Because this is a desert unit, precipitation affects antler growth a lot from one year to the next. If you hope to get away from other hunters you will need to go places ATV’s can’t go. \n<br>\nThis area is patrolled quite frequently by DWR personnel.  Keep this in mind when you are transporting your game.  Try to make it easy to access the permit and tag on the animal.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" or “In-reach” type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Thunderstorms can cause muddy road conditions and rare flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with keeping their harvest meat cool.  Plan on hot weather and plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Most of the deer are found on the Sheeprock and Simpson Mountains. Few deer are on Desert and Keg Mountains during the hunting season. The average buck harvested on this unit is a 24” wide four point, which means half the bucks harvested are smaller than this. A hunter will have to spend a lot of time and effort to harvest a buck larger than 25” wide. Most of the deer are associated with mountain brush (buckbrush) communities, including serviceberry and snowberry. Concentrate your efforts in the highest elevations and near water sources. Deer can also be found in agricultural areas, written permission is needed to hunt these areas. Most archery hunters are able to locate 20 or more bucks a day.\n<br>\nThis unit could experience a wide range of weather events. If it snows I would still expect bucks to remain higher in elevation. \n\n",
