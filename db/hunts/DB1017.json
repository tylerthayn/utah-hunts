			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Book Cliffs offers a challenging landscape.  There are large ridges with steep canyons dividing them.  Most of the canyons and ridges have roads or ATV trails to provide access.  There are plenty of areas to hike and get away from the main roads.  The hunting pressure will drastically decrease after opening weekend.  \n\nThere are two roads that allow you to drive across the majority of the Book Cliffs.  The Kings Well Rd starts at the Seep Ridge Rd on the west side, and it can take you all the way to the Dragon Rd on the east side.  The Indian Ridge Road starts at the Seep Ridge Rd and goes through the bottom of Sweet Water, top of McCook Ridge, Bitter Creek, and to Big Park.  It is a great road to locate deer during this time of year.  \n<br>\nMost hunters are able to locate 20-40 bucks a day.  The Book Cliffs has one of the highest success rates for rifle hunters in the state.  Some hunters are disappointed in the quality of bucks so I would suggest trying to spend some time in the area to become familiar with the steep terrain and the quality of bucks.  There are not many 30” bucks on this unit.  The average buck harvested on this unit is basically a 23” 4 point or 3 x 4.  This area provides challenging terrain in a remote part of the state.    \n\nThere are other hunts that coincide with the any weapon deer hunt.  They are: limited entry bear, bear pursuit, and upland game hunts.  In the past deer hunters have had negative experiences with bear hunters in the area.  Please be aware that everyone has an equal right to hunt this area.  If you really want to get away from ATV and vehicle traffic I would plan on hiking in the more remote areas.  \n\nA Book Cliffs deer committee was formed to come up with a solution to the buck to doe problem on this unit.  The southern side of the unit consistently has a higher buck to doe ratio than the north.  It was proposed by the committee to split the rifle hunt to harvest more bucks on the south, side to bring the buck to doe ratio into compliance with the management plan.  The Wildlife Board accepted the proposal and now we have two hunt units for the any weapon hunt.  The reason we didn’t split the other hunts was because the deer are concentrated along the Divide Ridge during the archery and muzzle loader hunts.   This unit offers more road access, and more total deer than the southern unit.  \n\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nThe Book Cliffs mountain range is one of the more remote areas in Utah.  There are no service stations for many miles.  Plan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n\nThe Book Cliffs has a high bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears.  If you do have problems with bears please report them to the DWR Northeastern Regional Office as soon as possible (435 781-9453), or call the local dispatch center (435 789-4222).    \n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and snow.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:\nThe deer will be relatively close to water sources until it snows.  There are numerous springs in the heads of the steep canyons.  The local ranches keep small ponds and reservoirs full, but don’t rely on them to always be full of water.  There are four main drainages that have streams.  They are: Willow Creek, Sweet Water, Bitter Creek, and Evacuation Creek.  The deer will be congregated around these areas because they are key water sources while they migrate off higher elevations.  The east side of the Book Cliffs borders Colorado, and there are several deer later in the hunt that migrate down from Colorado.  \n\nSome of the areas where hunters have harvested in the past are: Flat Rock, Agency Draw, Willow Creek, Wood Canyon, Indian Ridge, PR Springs, McCook Ridge, Bitter Creek, Big Park, Wolf Den, Atchee Ridge, Three Mile Canyon, Evacuation Creek, Park Canyon, and Rabbit Mountain.  The elevation plays a key role in where you will find deer during this time of year.  I suggest if you are not seeing deer to change your elevation. \n\nMigration Patterns:\nThe mule deer migrate to the higher elevation in late spring.  The does fawn on the summer range, and most of the bucks stay on the summer range until they strip their velvet.  The Book Cliffs has limited by summer range.  By mid-October the deer start to migrate to their winter range and can be found in the transitional zone.  This is a large area where the deer can hole up until storms start to move them to their winter range.  This area is made up of a lot of pinyon/juniper trees, mahogany, bitter brush, sage brush and grasses.    \n\nFrom past biological studies we have found that approximately two thirds of the deer migrate to the north.\n\nScouting Tips:\nA good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  During this time the bucks are not likely to stay in the same general area.  It would be best to come out a few days before the hunt opener to find the elevation where the majority of the bucks are located.  I would scout the transitional areas.  I would not plan on scouting during the late summer or early fall for this hunt.  The deer will start to leave the high country until early to mid-October.  I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset.  There are several recovering burned areas on McCook Ridge.  \n\nBehavior:\nLike other wildlife, deer are most active in the early mornings and evenings.  Their behavior is dictated by the weather as well.  As the hunt progresses I would expect to see the bucks become more active during the day.  \n\nRain and snow provides much needed drinking water for deer, and can eliminate a need to travel to more sustainable water sources.  The bucks will be breaking up from their bachelor groups.  I would expect their behavior and routine to change after all of the hunting pressure from opening weekend\n",
