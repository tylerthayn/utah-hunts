			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Zion unit is an area that has had good mule deer production and the population is generally at or over the objective in the management plan.  The unit is also over the general season buck objective of 18-20 bucks per 100 does.  This has resulted in the opportunity to hunt mule deer during this late season muzzleloader hunt to provide opportunity and harvest additional bucks to reach the unit objectives.  \n\nHigh deer densities can be found across winter range.  The highest densities can be found on the southeastern portion of the unit including areas along and south of SR9 and east of Zion National Park.  Landmark areas include Poverty Flat, Elephant Gap, and the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park.  There is no hunting allowed in Zion.  \n\nSubstantial numbers of wintering deer may also be found south of Cedar City along I-15, south to the New Harmony exit.  Additionally, good mule deer winter range exists south of Zion National Park on Smith Mesa and the surrounding drainages.  \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Zion unit offers substantial truck and ATV access.  Cellular phone coverage within this hunt boundary can be spotty.  \n\nThe biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nPlan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, as well as winter conditions.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "69.2~19000~14850~18–20~18.5~~~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:  The majority of hunters tend to hunt on public lands managed by the BLM and SITLA.  Typically hunters are successful if they are certain where public lands and access roads exist within the hunt boundary, so study some property boundary maps.  A 4WD or ATV will be useful to for access at this time of year.  \n\nMigration Patterns:  \nThe migratory segments of this population may begin their fall movements in late September and October.  Migration from summer ranges may be dependent on fall storms and weather conditions.  Most deer will be on winter range during this hunt.  \n\nScouting Tips:\nA good spotting scope and binoculars will be helpful. Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens since deer are still moving and will be in or close to the rut.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate public lands and access points.   \n\nBehavior:  Mule deer should be in rut and preparing for winter during this hunt and therefore may be found in large groups.  They should be in a high level of activity feeding and in rutting behaviors.   \n",
