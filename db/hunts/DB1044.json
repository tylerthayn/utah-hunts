			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Most hunters are able to locate 20-40 bucks a day.  The Book Cliffs has one of the highest success rates for archery hunters in the state.  Some hunters are disappointed in the quality of bucks so I would suggest trying to spend some time in the area to become familiar with the steep terrain and the quality of bucks.  There are not many 30 in bucks on this unit.  The average buck harvested on this unit is basically a 22” 4 point or 3x4.  This area provides challenging terrain in a remote part of the state.    \n\nThere are other hunts that coincide with the muzzleloader deer hunt.  They are: limited entry elk, limited entry bear, bear pursuit, and upland game hunts.  In the past, deer hunters have had negative experiences with bear hunters in the area.  Please be aware that everyone has an equal right to hunt this area.  The Book Cliffs is an incredibly large area, but during summer and early fall most of the animals are congregated in a small area.  If you really want to get away from ATV and vehicle traffic I would plan on hunting in the Little Creek WMA (roadless area).<br>\n\nThe Ute Tribe as agreed to allow sportsmen to access this area across Ute Tribal trust lands.  Once you leave the Sego Trailhead parking area and start down the Went Ridge trail you are on Tribal land for the first few miles.  There are signs indicating that you have permission from the Tribe to use this route.  We ask that you please keep this area clean and stay on the main trail until you are off of Ute Tribal land.  This is a privilege and abuse of this area could lead to sportsmen losing this access permit.  This hunt excludes all Ute Tribal lands.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nThe Book Cliffs mountain range is one of the more remote areas in Utah.  There are no service stations for many miles.  Plan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n\nThe Book Cliffs has a high bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears.  If you do have problems with bears please report them to the DWR Northeastern Regional Office as soon as possible (435 781-9453), or call the local dispatch center (435 789-4222).    \n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and snow.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   \n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:  You will find the majority of the deer located along the Divide Road.  The Book Cliffs range divides the north from the south with a long ridge that runs east to west.  The Seep Ridge Rd becomes the Divide Rd and runs east to Colorado and West to Steer Ridge.  The Book Cliffs has limited summer range.  The majority of the deer are going to be located along the Divide Rd.  \n\nThe deer will be relatively close to water sources.  There are numerous springs in the heads of the steep canyons.  The local ranches keep small ponds and reservoirs full, but don’t rely on them to always be full of water.  \n\nSome of the areas where hunters have harvested in the past are: Rat Hole Ridge and Canyon, Rail Road Canyon, Black Horse and Saddle Horse Ridge, PR Springs, Horse Point, Moon Ridge, Cherry Mesa, Rock Springs Mesa, Cedar Camp, Steer Ridge, and Little Creek Ridge.  \n\nThe elevation plans a key role in where you will find deer during this time of year.  I suggest if you are not seeing deer to change your elevation.  \n\nMigration Patterns:  The mule deer migrate to the higher elevation in late spring.  The does fawn on the summer range, and most of the bucks stay on the summer range until they strip their velvet.  The Book Cliffs has limited by summer range.  By mid-October the deer start to migrate to their winter range and can be found in the transitional zone.  This is a large area where the deer can hole up until storms start to move them to their winter range.  This area is made up of a lot of pinyon/juniper trees, mahogany, bitter brush, sage brush and grasses.    \n\nFrom past biological studies we have found that approximately two thirds of the deer migrate to the north.\n\nScouting Tips:  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective the last couple weeks before the hunt opens when they are more likely to stay in the same general area.  I would scout the higher ridges where oak brush is prominent.  Your preseason scouting can really pay off on this hunt.  The deer won’t start to leave the high country until mid-October.  The bucks might not be on the same ridge, but I would expect them to stay with-in a five mile radius.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset.  There are several recovering burned areas along the Divide.  The oak brush is starting to get more established and creates great habitat for mule deer.     \n\nBehavior:  Like other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings.  Their behavior is dictated by the weather as well.  Rain provides more areas for them to drink, and can eliminate a need to travel more sustainable water sources.  The bucks will still be in bachelor groups of three to as many as ten in a group.  They will often bed down together so it can be difficult to close the distance.  They will tend to use the same game trails and with good pre scouting you might be able to pattern a bucks movements.  I would expect their behavior to change after all of the hunting pressure from opening weekend.\n",
