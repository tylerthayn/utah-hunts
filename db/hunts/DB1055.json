In recent years the unit has experienced small decreas in the deer population and in the buck/doe ratio. Deer hunting has been good. Though not managed as a trophy unit, hunters have been noticing good numbers of mature bucks.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nDeer populate the entire unit and can move in response to hunting pressure and weather. Elevations range from 5,000 ft valleys to peaks over 11,000 ft. Vegetation communities range from sagebrush, pinyon/juniper, to aspen/conifer.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a large area and cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for hot & dry, or rainy, lightening, windy or even snowy conditions.  Early snow storms sometimes occur during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.  During the archery season hunters should be prepared to cool harvested game quickly due to warm temperatures.",

In recent years the unit has experienced a decrease in the deer population and in the buck/doe ratio. Deer hunting has been good. Though not managed as a trophy unit, hunters have been noticing an increased number of mature bucks.\n<br>\n <br>\n\nDeer populate the entire unit and can move in response to hunting pressure and weather. Elevations range from 5,000 ft valleys to peaks over 11,000 ft. Vegetation communities range from sagebrush, pinyon/juniper, to aspen/conifer.\n<br>\n\n<br>\n<u>Limited Entry Muzzleloader Season:</u>\nIn late October and early November the deer on the Fish Lake unit tend to be very spread out. On much of the unit some of the deer have moved onto or near their winter range. Snow levels permitting, there are also some deer on the highest peaks. Hunters should use scouting just prior to the season to locate deer concentrations. Hunters often concentrate in areas where deer are easily seen near agricultural areas. \n<br><br>\n\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nSome of the deer on Fish Lake unit begin to migrate to or closer to their winter range in mid-October. By the time this early November hunt arrives a sizable portion of the herd is often in the transitional ranges between their winter and summer ranges. However many deer also stay as high as they can until heavy snows push them lower. Most of the migration is rather simple, the deer just move up or down in elevation. However there are some deer that move from their summering areas on the north and central parts of the unit to the southern, eastern, and western parts of the unit closer to their winter range. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Mule Deer Rut:</u> The mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid December. For this hunt expect bucks to be just beginning to rut. Many of the bucks will be with the does but some will not.\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Recommended Areas to Hunt on the Fish Lake Unit:</u>\nThere are deer spread across the entire Fish Lake unit. During the archery and muzzleloader hunts concentrate in areas above 8,000 ft.  During the any-weapon hunt the deer are spread from the top of the mountain to the valley floors. During this early November muzzleloader hunt the deer will be very spread out unless there have been significant snow storms.  Every year a few older age class bucks are taken. There is no single area that produces more than others. The key is to scout your areas before the hunt to look for the deer you want. If deer numbers are not significant at you elevation try lower or high elevations depending on the snow.\n",
