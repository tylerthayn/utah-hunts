			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is managed as a General Season deer hunt and is not necessarily managed for trophy bucks, but every year a few nice bucks are taken. Hunters should be aware of the Ute Tribal Lands and learn the boundaries. Public hunting is not permitted on Tribal Lands. There are no CWMUs on this unit. The Uintah Mountain range can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but there are also less deer. Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for deer. It is generally Lodge Pole Pine without much of an understory. There are several four wheeler roads and dirt roads that provide a lot of access on much of the unit. The Bonanza unit has very low deer densities.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "There is spotty cell service in some of the lower elevation hunting areas and typically on the faces overlooking the Uinta Basin. However, there are many areas with no phone service so let someone know where you are going and when you will be back. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for warm & dry, or rainy, lightening, windy or snowy conditions. Early snow storms occur often during this hunt. Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so. Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Migration Patterns: Deer on this unit migrate down in elevation for the winter and tend to stay on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.\n\nMule Deer rut: This hunt gets close to the the mule deer rut that usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec.<br>\n<br>\n\nRecommended areas in the South Slope, Vernal: There are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit.\n\nThere is a variety of habitat to hunt during this late muzzleloader hunt. There is pinyon/juniper, sage brush savanna, thick lodge pole pine and areas above timber line. The larger openings on the forest are called parks and can be found on most maps but the smaller openings are scattered across the high country. If you choose to hunt the high country, be prepared for unpredictable weather and rocky terrain.\n\nDuring the hunts most of the deer on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes with sagebrush and conifer. That zone across the South Slope is the most productive for deer. The suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit:\n\nWhiterocks Canyon– Whiterocks River is the western unit boundary, steep terrain.\nParadise Park- Higher forest terrain, steep forested canyons.\nMosby Mountain- High aspen forest, with large sagebrush bowls, excellent habitat.\nRed Cloud Loop Rd- Long road that starts in Dry Fork Canyon (west of Vernal). It takes you all the way through the Vernal unit, and comes out on Hwy 191..\nTaylor Mountain- Great vantage points. Excellent area to glass and locate animals from far distances.\nColton Ranger Station- Aspen/conifer mix forest.\nLimestone, Little V, and Range Study- These areas are east of Hwy 191 and border the Diamond Mountain limited entry deer and elk unit, know the boundary and your location.",
