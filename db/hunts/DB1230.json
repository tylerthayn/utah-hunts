			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Double R Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is southeast of Strawberry Reservoir and south of the Strawberry River. The high point of the Unit is more in the middle of the Unit at over 9000 feet, the north extension of the Willow Creek Ridge. This high point drops away to 8200 feet on the west and 8000 feet on the south. Willow Creek cuts the Unit on the west (8000 to 7300 feet), and Bear Canyon cuts the unit on the east (8600 feet to 7400 feet).  The most common elevation is 8800 feet but ranges from 7500 feet to 9500 feet with an elevation difference of 2000 feet.  Fifty-one percent (51%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 8200 feet and 8900 feet an elevation difference of 700 feet.<br><br>About forty percent (40%) of the Double R Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62). This Sagebrush Steppe has large patches of Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22) scattered throughout it.  To a lesser extent there are smaller patches of Rocky Mountain Subalpine Mesic Spruce-fir Forest and Woodland (28) and Rocky Mountain Bigtooth Maple Ravine Woodland (23) mingled with the Sagebrush Steppe and Aspen. There are areas of Rocky Mountain Cliff and Canyon (5). Also, Rocky Mountain Subalpine Dry-Mesic Spruce-fir Forest and Woodland (26) and Rocky Mountain Montane Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland (32) add to the Forest and Woodland character of the Unit.<br><br>One of the Double R Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, FRUITLAND (423056), is about 14.5 km northeast from the northeast edge of the CWMU.  FRUITLAND has fifty-six (56) years of records, 1910 - 1966.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 3.92 inches, but it can be as high as 7.89 inches or as low as 1.55 inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 15 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 11 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 2 day of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  There is also 1 day with greater than or equal to 1.00 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 7.9 inches but can be as high as 19.0 inches.  FALL temperature at FRUITLAND averages 43.9 degrees F. but can be as high as 86.0 degrees F. or as low as -8.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 56 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and no days above 90 degrees F.",
