			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The East Zion Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is located between the east entrance of Zion National Park and Mt. Carmel Junction on Highway 89. It is one block of land that ranges from 6000 feet to 7400 feet. <br><br>The two (2) dominate land cover types on the East Zion Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) are Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41) and Colorado Plateau Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (36). There are a many land cover types (33 types), but they make up a small parts of the total cover.<br><br>One of the East Zion Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, ORDERVILLE (426534), is 1.2 km east of the east edge of the CWMU.  ORDERVILLE has ninety-eight (98) years of records, 1910 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 3.78 inches, but it can be as high as 11.32 inches or as low as 0.54 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 12 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 8 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 3 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  There is also 1 day with precipitation greater than or equal to 1.00 inch.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 2.4 inches but can be as high as 17.0 inches.  FALL temperature at ORDERVILLE averages 53.9 degrees F. but can be as high as 100.0 degrees F. or as low as -1.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 35 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 1 day above 90 degrees F. <br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nMany of the deer on this unit migrate down in elevation beginning in the second or third week of October. Dry or wet conditions will dictate where you can find deer during the hunting seasons. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt. On years with cooler weather some of the larger bucks will start into some pre rut behavior in the last week of October.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas to hunt:</u>\n<br>\n\nThe Zion Unit has a healthy deer population.  Deer densities are high in good deer habitat.  Expect to see several bucks each day.  To increase your chances of seeing deer it is best to find water in good deer habitat. During the rifle hunt most deer are in transition to their wintering habitat.  Some deer will still be higher on Forest Service and Private lands, but most will be on the lower elevation BLM and private lands.    There are several livestock tanks, springs and a few guzzlers in this semi-desert area.    Some good areas to hunt are the following: \n<br>\n",
