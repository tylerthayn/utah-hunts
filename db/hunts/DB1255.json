			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Johnson Mountain Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is located up Salina Creek and south of Interstate 70.\nThe high point occurs near the southwest corner at 9900 feet. The elevation from this point decreases to the north with some broad valleys and lower elevation mountains on the east side of the Unit. After decreasing to 8000 feet the northern high point is 8200 feet. Niotche Creek cuts the north part of the Unit ranging from 6700 feet to 7300 feet. In the south Yugo Creek cuts the south part of the Unit. It ranges from 7100 feet to 9500 feet. Beaver Creek\n(8500 feet to 9500 feet), Spring Creek (7300 feet to 9500 feet), and Blackham Creek (7300 feet to 9500 feet) all flow into Yugo Creek in the south.  The most common elevation is 7300 feet but ranges from 6700 feet to 9800 feet with an elevation difference of 3100 feet.  Fifty percent (50%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7400 feet and 9000 feet an elevation difference of 1600 feet.\n\n<br><br>The southern part of the Johnson Mountain Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is covered with Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22), the dominant land cover type. Towards the middle of the Unit the Aspen Forest and Woodland grades into areas of mixed Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41) and Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrsuh Steppe (62). Much of the north part of this Unit has a mixture of Colorado\nPlateau Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (36) and Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland (48). There is one large area of Agriculture (114) in the north.\n<br><br>One of the Johnson Mountain Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, SALINA (427557), is about 12.4 km northeast from the northeast edge of the CWMU.  SALINA has seventy-four (74) years of records, 1923 - 2007.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 2.48 inches, but it can be as high as 6.67 inches or as low as 0.43 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 12 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 8 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 1 day of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Total FALL snowfall averages 2.8 inches but can be as high as 18.0 inches.  FALL temperature at SALINA averages 49.9 degrees F. but can be as high as 102.0 degrees F. or as low as -8.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 48 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and less than 4 days above 90 degrees F.",
