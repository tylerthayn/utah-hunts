Enter at 7600 feet and exiting at 6800 feet flowing from east to west.  In the south Neil Creek enters the unit at 7800 feet and exits into the Weber River at about 6900 feet flowing from west to east. The most common elevation is 7500 feet but ranges from 6700 feet to 8500 feet with an elevation difference of 1800 feet.  Fifty-seven percent (57%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7500 feet and 8500 feet an elevation difference of 1000 feet.<br><br>Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22) is the dominant land cover on the Neil Creek Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU).  This Forest and Woodland cover nearly half of the unit.  Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41) and Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62) are two other common land cover types on the CWMU.<br><br>One of the Neil Creek Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, ECHO DAM (422385), is about 1.2 km west from the west edge of the CWMU.  ECHO DAM has sixty-seven (67) years of records, 1940 - 2007.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 3.88 inches, but it can be as high as 10.59 inches or as low as 0.47 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 21 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 11 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 2 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 12.1 inches but can be as high as 41.5 inches.  FALL temperature at ECHO DAM averages 46.5 degrees F. but can be as high as 97.0 degrees F. or as low as -21.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 54 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 3 days above 90 degrees F.",
