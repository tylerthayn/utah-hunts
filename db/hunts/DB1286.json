			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Pisgah Mountain Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) lies on the border of Box Elder and Cache Counties, about 1.5 km north of Mantua, Utah.  Mount Pisgah (7100 feet) is one of the higher elevations, and most of the higher elevations are along the county boundary.  On the westside are elevations reaching 6600 feet on the eastside 5200 feet.  Dry Canyon enters the CWMU at 5200 feet and peaks at 5800 feet at Sardine Summit.  A road in McMudie Hollow in the north forming the unit boundary ranges from 5000 feet to 5600 feet.<br><br>Over forty percent of the Sardine Canyon Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit land cover (44%) is classified as Rocky Mountain Bigtooth Maple Ravine Woodland.  This Ravine Woodland is distributed over the entire CWMU.  Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62) covers 24% of the unit.  This sagebrush steppe is distributed like the Ravine Woodland throughout the unit.  Another land cover contributor is an invasive, Invasive\t\nPerennial Grassland (119).  It covers about 8% of the CWMU, some in the northeast and some in the middle-south.<br><br>One of the Sardine Canyon Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, BRIGHAM CITY WASTE (420928), is 5.4 km east of the east edge of the CWMU.  BRIGHAM CITY WASTE  has thirty-four (34) years of records, 1974 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 4.68 inches, but it can be as high as 13.72 inches or as low as 0.60 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 19 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 11 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 3 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  There is also 1 day with precipitation greater than or equal to 1.00 inch.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 2.9 inches but can be as high as 29.0 inches.  FALL temperature at BRIGHAM CITY WASTE  averages 50.4 degrees F. but can be as high as 96.0 degrees F. or as low as -1.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 34 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 3 day above 90 degrees F.",
