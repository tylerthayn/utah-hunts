			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Double J Valley Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is south and southeast of East Canyon Reservoir. East Canyon Creek cuts the Unit on the west side (5000 to 5800 feet). Big Dutch Hollow and Sheep Creek enter from the east, and Little Dutch Hollow and Asp Creek come in from the west.  State Road 62 comes in at the northwest corner.  The most common elevation is 6400 feet but ranges from 5700 feet to 7600 feet with an elevation difference of 1900 feet.  Fifty-six percent (56%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 6600 feet and 7600 feet an elevation difference of 1000 feet.<br><br>Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62) is the dominate land cover type on the CWMU.  This Steppe type covers nearly a third of the unit.  Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane\nShrubland (41) is also a important land cover type.  Less than the Montane Shrubland, but still an important land cover is Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22).<br><br>One of the T J Cattle Company Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, WANSHIP DAM (429165), is about 3.7 km east from the east edge of the CWMU.  WANSHIP DAM has fifty-two (52) years of records, 1955 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 4.50 inches, but it can be as high as 9.65 inches or as low as 1.14 inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 23 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 13 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 2 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 12.4 inches but can be as high as 39.0 inches.  FALL temperature at WANSHIP DAM averages 45.5 degrees F. but can be as high as 93.0 degrees F. or as low as -21.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 57 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 1 day above 90 degrees F.",
