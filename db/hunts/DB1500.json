			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  Hunters should be aware of the private property and learn the boundaries. There are many areas within this unit that you can get away from the roads and other hunters.  Deer are naturally more abundant in these areas.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Hunters that go into these areas should prepare for every weather condition and little to no cell phone coverage. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for hot & dry, or rainy, lightning, windy or even snowy conditions.  Early snow storms occur often during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.  ",

Deer on the archery hunt are found at higher elevation. As hunting pressure persists deer move into the thicker cover.   If you choose to hunt the high country, be prepared for unpredictable weather and lots of rocks.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nDuring the hunts most of the deer on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes with sagebrush and conifer.  That zone across the Beaver is the most productive for deer.  Every canyon across the Beaver has deer and they are of similar quality. \n<br><br>\n\n<u>The suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit):</u><br>\n\n<i>Big Johns Flat</i>- Plenty of Access and camping<br>\n<i>Big Flat</i>- Plenty of access and camping<br>\n<i>Kents Lake</i>- Popular camping area must hike off the road to get away from people<br>\n<i>Rainbow Mine</i>- Limited road access<br>\n<i>Cottonwood Creek</i>- limited road access<br>\n<i>City Creek Peak</i> - limited road access, popular area<br>\n<i>Lebaron Reservoir</i>- limited road access, popular area<br>\n<i>Mumford Resevoir</i> – Limited access, steep areas<br>\n<i>Bakers Canyon</i> - popular area <br>\n<i>Briggs Ridge</i> – remote hunting area, steep terrain<br>\n<i>Shingle Creek Meadows</i>- Some ATV trails and remote hunting opportunities.<br>\n<i>North Creek</i> – Limited Access<br>\n<i>Manderfield</i>- gravel roads, a little flatter area, be aware of private Property<br>\n",
