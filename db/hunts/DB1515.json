			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The majority of land is managed by BLM and US forest Service.  There is a  DWR Wildlife Management Area (WMA) known as the Pine Canyon WMA.  This area is managed for wildlife and the DWR encourages hunting on all WMA’s. Pine Canyon generally holds a few deer during the hunting seasons. Heaston East CWMU and Camp Williams Military Base are not included in any on these hunts.<br>\n<br>\n  Most hunters plan on spending 3-4 days hunting.  There are few water sources so plan on bringing extra water in with you. Some hunters who do not have much horse experience camp at the trail heads and hike in and out every day.  I would plan on a very challenging and rewarding hunt.  Be aware of private land. Review your maps frequently to avoid trespass issues especially in Ophir Canyon.\n\nThis area is patrolled quite frequently by DWR personnel.  Keep this in mind when you are transporting your game.  Try to make it easy to access the permit and tag on the animal.   \n ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "There are very remote location with a few areas having limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is fair over most this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The Biologist suggests handheld radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with meat spoiling in the heat.  I would plan on hot weather and plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting deer in this area.  Scouting is most effective mid-summer.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bucks.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset).  There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of edge that is excellent for deer. Deer spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.       \n\nThere are very few signs on the trails.  I would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area. ",
