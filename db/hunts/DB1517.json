			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  The Pine Valley Unit is 90% public land, but hunters should be aware of the private lands and learn the boundaries.  Deer on the Archery hunt are spread out across their summer ranges deer densities are higher in some areas than they are in other.  Some high deer density areas also have higher numbers of hunters and can result in some hunter crowding. Please be aware of other hunters and be courteous. Day time temperatures during the archery hunt can still reach into the low 90’s.  On years with good monsoonal moisture the deer may be spread out more across their range.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "It can be very hot during this season.  Please be prepared with plenty of water.  Make sure friends and family know where you area going and when you will return.  Be aware of rattle snakes!",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "15.4~19500~15500~18–20~19.4~~~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nMany of the deer on this unit migrate down in elevation beginning in the second or third week of October. Dry or wet conditions will dictate where you can find deer during the hunting seasons.  Migration should not be a factor on this hunt. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. So it does not affect this hunt.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas to hunt:</u>\n\nThe Pine Valley Unit has a healthy deer population.  Deer densities are high in good deer habitat.  Expect to see several bucks each day.  To increase your chances of seeing deer it is best to find water in good deer habitat.  There are several livestock tanks, springs and guzzlers in this semi-desert area.    <br>\nSome good areas to hunt are the following: \n<br>\n\n\nBull Valley Mountains – Forest Service and small tracts of private land South and West of Enterprise. This area is very accessible by vehicles. Deer densities decrease as you move further west towards the Nevada state line.  Hunting is best in oak brush and service berry near water sources.\n<br>\n\n\nBumblebee Mtn. – BLM, USFS, and SITLA SW of Cedar City.  The higher elevation areas in the oak brush best for locating deer. Access is limited to a few main roads and ATV trails.  Hunters will do better if they get out and do some hiking and spotting deer.  \n<br>\n\nParadise and Pine Valley Wilderness – Forest Service land from Pace Draw NW of New Harmony to the south face of the Pine Valley Mtn.  This area is remote and has little to no vehicle access.  There are several foot and horse trails into the area.  Some access points are the Anderson and Comanche trail head in the New Harmony area, The Grants Ranch trail head between New Harmony and Pinto, The Paradise trail head near Pinto, The Mill Canyon and Water Canyon trail heads south of the Town of Pine Valley in Grass Valley, The Whipple and Forsyth trail heads in Pine Valley. The further you are willing to hike in the better the hunting may become. \n<br>\n\nAtchison and Harrison Peak – Forest Service land Between Mountain Meadow and Grass Valley.  Mostly sagebrush and serviceberry habitat with some scattered pinion and juniper.  This area has limited access and with a few ATV trails.  Hiking in a ½ mile plus from the roads will increase success in finding the bucks.\n",
