			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  Hunters should be aware of the Ute tribal Lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on tribal lands.  There are no CWMUs on this unit.  The unit includes the High Uintas Wilderness area.  The wilderness can provide a remote hunt with few hunters, but there are also fewer deer.  Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for deer.  It is generally Lodge Pole Pine with little understory.  \nRoad access on much of the unit is limited to mostly canyon bottoms due to the steepness of the terrain.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for hot, dry, or rainy, lightening, and windy conditions.  Early snow storms can occur, but are fairly rare during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so during this hunt.  Be prepared for dry or muddy road conditions.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Migration Patterns:\nDeer on this unit move down in elevation for the winter and they winter primarily on Ute tribal Lands and on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  The deer also move down towards the tribal land boundary as soon as they get much hunting pressure.  There is very little hunting pressure on the tribal lands so some deer have learned to go there as soon as hunting pressure starts.\n\nMule Deer rut:\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n\nRecommended areas in the South Slope, Yellowstone:\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. \n\nThe wilderness area can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but there are also fewer deer.  Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for deer.  It is generally Lodge Pole Pine with little understory.  Deer in the wilderness are generally found above tree line or in small pockets of openings in the lodge pole cover.  The larger openings are called parks and can be found on most maps but the smaller openings are scattered across the high country.  If you choose to hunt the high country, be prepared for unpredictable weather and lots of rocks.\n\nDuring the hunts most of the deer on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes with sagebrush and conifer.  That zone across the South Slope is the most productive for deer.  Every canyon across the South Slope, Yellowstone has deer and they are of similar quality. \n\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit:\nSoapstone area - high elevation, but more road access, closer to the Wasatch Front\nNorth Fork of the Duchesne- limited road access\nBlind Stream - limited road access, tribal land down low, popular area\nLog Hollow- must cross tribal Lands to access, rough roads\nRock Creek - paved road access, steep areas\nPigeon Water - popular area but hunters must be aware of tribal boundary\nBear Wallow - hunters must be aware of tribal boundary, steep terrain\nLake Fork/Moon Lake- paved road access, some private property along the paved road.\nYellowstone - rough roads, need to be aware of tribal boundary\n77 Flat/Burnt Mill- gravel roads, a little flatter area, be aware of tribal boundary\nDry Gulch- very rough road, steep terrain, be aware of tribal boundary on the east \nUinta Canyon- tribal lands down low, steep terrain\nElk Horn Loop - gravel roads that go almost to the summit of the Uinta Mountains, lots of opportunity to scatter out\nWhiterocks Canyon - Whiterocks River is the eastern unit boundary",
