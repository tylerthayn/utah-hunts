			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  Fifty percent of the deer habitat is public land, but hunters should be aware of the private lands and learn the boundaries.  Large blocks of the best deer habitat on this unit are private lands. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two.  Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nMany of the deer on this unit migrate down in elevation beginning in the second or third week of October. Dry or wet conditions will dictate where you can find deer during the hunting seasons.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt. On years with cooler weather some of the larger bucks will start into some pre rut behavior.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas to hunt:</u>\nThe Zion Unit has a healthy deer population.  Deer densities are high in good deer habitat.  Expect to see several bucks each day.  To increase your chances of seeing deer it is best to find water in good deer habitat. During the archery hunt most deer are still in their summer habitat.  Most deer will be at the middle to higher elevations from oak brush to the aspen and mixed conifer zone.  About 59% of deer summer habitat on the Zion unit is on private lands.  The northern portions of the unit south of Highway 14 are the best places for public access onto Forest Service land.<br>\nSome good areas to hunt are the following:<br>\nWebster’s Flat and Deep Creek – Forest Service land From Woods Ranch area in Cedar Canyon to just east of the Zion Overlook.  The Deep Creek area is a USFS roadless area.  Access can be found at the trail head a short distance above the turn off to Webster’s Flat on Highway 14.<br>\n\nMidway – USFS land from the turn off to Cedar Breaks east to Navajo Lake.  The old clear cut logging areas and meadows in the Deer Valley area usually have a fair amount of deer use. <br> \n\nStrawberry Ridge and Harris Flat- USFS land between Strawberry Cabins area and east to Stout Canyon.  This is a ponderosa pine are that has a good understory of bitterbrush. There is good access in to this area with several OHV trails and old logging roads.  This area has several wildlife and livestock water catch ponds.   This area has several cabin communities and hunters should be careful of private lands and how close they hunt to cabins. <br>\n\nStout Canyon and School Wash – USFS land with some larger blocks of private land.  This is a ponderosa pine habitat with a good understory of bitterbrush. There are a few OHV trails and logging roads that cut through this area.  <br>\n\nPrivate land - Some of the best deer habitat on the Zion unit is on private lands.  This unit is unusual for Southern Utah because of its large parcels of private lands that have several different land owners.  Obtaining permission to hunt these areas can be difficult, but is not impossible. <br>",
