			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The La Sal Mountains unit is one of the most beautiful places that you will ever encounter.  The unit has high alpine peaks, above 12,000 ft. and goes down to low desert valleys around 4,000 ft.  This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit however, every year a few nice bucks are taken.  There is good road access throughout the unit, however there are also many places that hunters can hike into and get away from the crowds.  Hunters should be aware of the CWMU's and private lands on the unit and learn the boundaries.  There are 2 CWMUs on this unit and a list is available on the UDWR webpage: <a href=\"http://wildlife.utah.gov/maps/public/list_cwmus.php\" target=\"_blank\">http://wildlife.utah.gov/maps/public/list_cwmus.php</a>",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Flash floods and lightning strikes are very likely during inclement weather, make sure to watch the sky and plan accordingly.  Always let somebody know where you'll be, and when you expect to be back.  Cell phone service is extremely limited throughout most of the unit.  Black bears are regularly seen on the La Sals.  Keep a clean camp and make sure to place all food and garbage in locations that bears cannot get into.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges and flash floods in the canyon bottoms.  Dirt roads on this unit can become extremely muddy, very quick.  Be attentive and use caution when traveling during stormy weather.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "47.9~8000~5900~15–17~18.4~~~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<b>Migration Patterns:</b> The Mule deer on the La Sals typically leave the higher elevations during mid to late fall and head for the winter range at lower elevations.  Winter range occurs in all directions from the mountain range.  In mid to late spring, the deer tend to follow the green-up of grasses/forbs and head back to higher elevations. \n\n<b>Scouting Tips:</b>  Start scouting in late July early August, most deer will be up high and typically seen feeding in large meadows early in the mornings and just before dark.  The deer may not be in the same place during the any weapon hunt, but early scouting will give you an idea of what kind of bucks are on the unit. Using quality binoculars or spotting scopes will be very valuable to you.  Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points.  \nTypically, bucks will be in bachelor groups from early to late summer.  Yearling bucks can be found year-round with does, or in bachelor groups.\n\n<b>Mule deer rut:</b> The mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Recommended areas for the any weapon hunt:</b>\n\nAny weapon hunters should focus on mid to low elevation areas.  If any snow accumulates, deer will start heading for lower elevations consisting of oak stands with large sagebrush clearings, intermixed with pinyon/juniper stands. ",
