			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "\nThe Monroe unit is a general season hunt unit and is managed to provide deer hunting opportunity. The unit is excellent deer habitat and is a popular place to hunt. In recent years, due to drought and a harsh winter, the unit has experienced an decrease in the deer population and a decrease in the buck/doe ratio. Buck permits have been decreased to reflect this change in the herd status. Deer hunting has still been good. Typically hunters experience a high success rate. Deer populate the entire Monroe unit, however the highest density of deer tend to be on central and northern parts of the unit. The southern portion of the unit is narrower, drier, as has fewer deer. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Weather Conditions: The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for hot, dry, or rainy, lightening, windy or even snowy conditions.  Early snow storms occur often during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "\nAny Weapon Season:\nIn late October the deer on the Monroe unit tend to be very spread out. On much of the unit some of the deer have moved onto or near their winter range. Snow levels permitting, there are also some deer on the highest peaks. Hunters should use scouting just prior to the season to locate deer concentrations. Hunters often concentrate in areas where deer are easily seen near agricultural areas. <br>\n<br>\n\nSome of the deer on Monroe begin to migrate to or closer to their winter range in early October. By the time the rifle hunt arrives a sizable portion of the herd has moved down in elevation, often concentrating their foraging activities in Agricultural areas. However many deer also stay as high as they can until heavy snows push them lower. Most of the migration is rather simple, the deer just move up or down in elevation. However there are some deer that move from their summering areas on the North part of the unit to some winter range near the town of Angle. Usually this movement is after the rifle hunting season.",

The south end of the mountain can be accessed with the Pole canyon road (#072) near Angle or the Monroe Mountain road (#068) near Kingston. Both of these are maintained but are rather narrow and not recommended for large trailers. To access the west side of the unit use the Dry Creek road (#071) or the Monroe Canyon road (#078).
