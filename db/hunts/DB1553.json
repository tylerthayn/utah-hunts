The unit includes the High Uintas Wilderness area.  The wilderness can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but there are also fewer deer.

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<b>General Considerations:</b> This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a\n\ntrophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  Hunters should be aware of the Ute \n\nTribal Lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on Tribal Lands.  There \n\nare no CWMUs on this unit.  The unit includes the High Uintas Wilderness area.  The \n\nWilderness can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but there are also less deer.  Much of the \n\nhabitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for deer.  It is generally Lodge Pole \n\nPine without much of an understory.  \n\nRoad access on much of the unit is limited to mostly canyon bottoms due to the steepness of the \n\nterrain.\n<br>\n\n<b>Weather Conditions:</b> The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting \n\nseason.  Be prepared for hot & dry, or rainy, lightening, windy or even snowy conditions.  Early \n\nsnow storms occur often during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or \n\nso.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.  \n\n<br>\n<b>Migration Patterns:</B>\n\nDeer on this unit move down in elevation for the winter and they winter primarily on Ute Tribal \n\nLands and on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  The deer also \n\nmove down towards the Tribal Land boundary as soon as they get much hunting pressure.  There \n\nis very little hunting pressure on the Tribal Lands so some deer have learned to go there as soon \n\nas hunting pressure starts.\n<br>\n\n<b>Mule Deer rut:</b>\n\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n\nRecommended areas in the South Slope, Yellowstone:\n\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. \n\nThe Wilderness Area can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but there are also less deer.  \n\nMuch of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for deer.  It is \n\ngenerally Lodge Pole Pine without much of an understory.  Deer in the Wilderness are generally \n\nfound above tree line or in small pockets of openings in the lodge pole cover.  The larger \n\nopenings are called parks and can be found on most maps but the smaller openings are scattered \n\nacross the high country.  If you choose to hunt the high country, be prepared for unpredictable \n\nweather and lots of rocks. \n\nDuring the hunts most of the deer on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes \n\nwith sagebrush and conifer.  That zone across the South Slope is the most productive for deer.  \n\nEvery canyon across the South Slope, Yellowstone has deer and they are of similar quality.<br><br> \n\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit:\n<br>\nSoapstone area - high elevation, but more road access, closer to the Wasatch Front.\n<br>\nNorth Fork of the Duchesne- limited road access\n<br>\nBlind Stream - limited road access, tribal land down low, popular area\n<br>\nLog Hollow- must cross Tribal Lands to access, rough roads\n<br>\nRock Creek - paved road access, steep areas\n<br>\nPigeon Water - popular area but hunters must be aware of tribal boundary\n<br>\nBear Wallow - hunters must be aware of tribal boundary, steep terrain\n<br>\nLake Fork/Moon Lake- paved road access, some private property along the paved road.\n<br>\nYellowstone - rough roads, need to be aware of Tribal boundary\n<br>\n77 Flat/Burnt Mill- gravel roads, a little flatter area, be aware of Tribal boundary\n<br>\nDry Gulch- very rough road, steep terrain, be aware of Tribal boundary on the east. \n<br>\nUinta Canyon- Tribal lands down low, steep Terrain\n<br>\nElk Horn Loop - gravel roads that go almost to the summit of the Uintas, lots of opportunity to \nscatter out.\n<br>\nWhiterocks Canyon - Whiterocks river is the eastern unit boundary, steep terrain.<br>   \n",
