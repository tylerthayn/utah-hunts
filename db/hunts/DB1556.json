The project area is located in Utah County, approximately 30 miles east southeast of Spanish Fork, Utah, and northwest of Soldier Summit from Highway 6.

There are many CWMUs on this unit and a list of these can be found on the UDWR webpage.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nDeer on this unit migrate down in elevation for the winter and typically from East to West, with most of the deer wintering on Wallsburg WMA, Sheep Creek and Diamond Fork canyons. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<u>Recommended areas to hunt:</u>\nThere are numerous areas to hunt on this unit. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe areas surrounding Strawberry Reservoir, Sheep Creek, Diamond Fork, Hobble Creek, American Fork canyons, Mt. Timpanogos are excellent for deer hunting. They are easy to access with many roads and trails and camping areas. This of course leads to many people hunting these areas. There are very few areas on this unit without a road in the general area. This unit has very large aspen stands, oak brush can hold a lot of deer in the early fall. In the summer there are deer in the more open higher areas, but once they get pressured by hunters they will move into the lower, thicker tree stands. These areas are difficult to hunt, because of the leaves on the trees and fewer open areas to glass with optics. There are also many lower areas with several different browse species, including; oak brush, service berry, mountain mahogany, bitter brush, snow berry, sage brush, etc. These areas also have deer in them during the hunt, but at a lower density. All ways look for areas that deer are watering in.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Some areas to hunt include the following: </u>\n<br>\n\n<i>Strawberry Reservoir area</i>- Try Indian canyon, Clyde Creek, Mud Creek, Squaw Creek, Horse Creek, Main canyon and Strawberry ridge.\n<br>\n\n<i>Sheep Creek area</i>- Try any of the waters ( First to Sixth) along Ray’s Valley road.\n<br>\n\n<i>Diamond Fork</i>- Diamond Fork is a mixture of public and private.\n<br>\n\n<i>Hobble Creek</i>- Right Hand fork is mostly public land, Left Hand Fork is mostly private land.\n<br>\n\n<i>American Fork Canyon/Mt. Timpanogos</i>-This area is steep and rugged.\n<br>\n\n<i>Timp WMA</i>-This area is real brushy but can be good hunting.\n<br>\n\n<i>Wallsburg WMA</i>-This WMA is mostly open sagebrush.  Hunting can be good in October.\n",

This road is really \nROAD CLOSURE CONSIDERATIONS The key objective is to construct these roadway improvements while minimizing impacts to public users. To facilitate public safety, certain segments of the road will be closed during various construction activities. When the road is open, delays up to 30 minutes can be expected. The construction schedule is subject to change. During road closures, no motorized vehicles will be permitted on the route. Adjacent Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) trail routes will continue to be open during road closures. Where a potential conflict between an OHV and construction equipment is possible, the OHV access will be restricted for public safety. Emergency access will be permitted at all times.\nROAD CLOSURE PRELIMINARY SCHEDULE\na combination of three smaller routes, Sheep Creek – Rays Valley Road (FR 70051); Unicorn Ridge – Indian Creek Road (FR 70042); and West Side Strawberry Road (FR 70131). The construction work will be split into four segments: Segment 1 (FR 70051) begins at the MP 0.0 (intersection with US-6) and ends at MP 7.0 (FR 70042). The work on Segment 1 consists of pavement rehabilitation including patching, crack sealing, and chip sealing. Segment 2 and Segment 3 (FR 70042) begins at MP 7.0 and ends at FR 70131. The work on Segment 2 and 3 consists of roadway bench widening, paving, drainage improvements, and safety improvements. Segment 4 (FR 70131) begins at the intersection with FR 70042 and ends 3.75 miles north of the intersection. The work on Segment 4 consists of pavement rehabilitation, pulverizing, and paving with subexcavation as needed.\nQUESTIONS?
