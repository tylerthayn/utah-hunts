Fifty percent of the deer habitat is public land, but hunters should be aware of the private lands and learn the boundaries.  Large Blocks of the best deer habitat on this unit are private lands. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two.  Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nMany of the deer on this unit migrate down in elevation beginning in the second or third week of October. Dry or wet conditions will dictate where you can find deer during the hunting seasons. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt. On years with cooler weather some of the larger bucks will start into some pre rut behavior in the last week of October.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas to hunt:</u>\n<br>\n\nThe Zion Unit has a healthy deer population.  Deer densities are high in good deer habitat.  Expect to see several bucks each day.  To increase your chances of seeing deer it is best to find water in good deer habitat. During the rifle hunt most deer are in transition to their wintering habitat.  Some deer will still be higher on Forest Service and Private lands, but most will be on the lower elevation BLM and private lands.    There are several livestock tanks, springs and a few guzzlers in this semi-desert area.    Some good areas to hunt are the following: \n<br>\n\n<i>East Zion</i> – BLM and SITLA land East of Zion National Park from Orderville south to the state line.  The Sands, Elephant Cove, Poverty Flat are all good areas to find deer in their migration. Be aware of smaller parcels of private land.\n<br>\n\n<i>Kolob Terrace</i> – BLM, SITLA and Private land between the town of Virgin and Kolob Reservoir. This area has some larger blocks of private land.  The migration pattern in this area is less consistent than the migration on the eastern portions of the unit.  Larger numbers of deer sometimes do not move to the lower elevations until after the hunt is over.  \n<br>\n\n<i>Toquerville Falls</i> – BLM and SITLA lands north of Toquerville.  This is a lower deer density area, but some good deer are spotted in this area each year.  The migration pattern is similar to the Kolob Terrace area.\n<br>\n\n<i>Kanarraville North Hills</i> – BLM, SITLA and Private land between Cedar City and Kanarraville. It usually takes some cooler weather or snow to move very many deer off the private land of Cedar and Kanarraville Mt. into this area, but when they do you can expect to find some nice bucks.\n<br>\n\n<i>Private land</i> - Some of the best deer habitat on the Zion unit is on private lands.  This unit is unusual for Southern Utah because of its large parcels of private lands that have several different land owners.  Obtaining permission to hunt these areas can be difficult, but is not impossible. \n\n",
