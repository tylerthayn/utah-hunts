			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a very productive unit with one of the largest deer herds in the state.  Muzzleloader hunters will find most success hunting on summer habitats at 7,500 feet and above.  In some years hunting on water sources can be productive but water is generally not limiting on the Manti portion of this unit.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Weather conditions in late September are generally pretty mild with warm days and cold nights.  There is rarely snow on the ground during this hunt and most deer are still found on high elevation summer ranges.  Roads are generally in good shape.  Be prepared for cold nights and occasional rainstorms which can make the roads muddy.  This can disrupt hunting and deer behavior as well as the ability to hunt on a water source.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "General Considerations: This is a very productive unit with one of the largest deer herds in the state.  Muzzleloader hunters will find most success hunting on summer habitats at 7,500 feet and above.  In some years hunting on water sources can be productive but water is generally not limiting on the Manti portion of this unit.  \n\nMigration Patterns:\nThere is very little deer migration during the muzzleloader hunt.  Deer remain on summer ranges typically at 7,500 feet and above.  When migration begins (typically in mid October to mid-December) deer move down in elevation to the sagebrush benches east of SR-89 on the west and the sagebrush benches west of SR-6 and SR-10 on the east side of the mountain.  There is very little seasonal movement of deer on the San Rafael portion of the unit.\n\n\nMule Deer rut:\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n\n\nRecommended areas to hunt:\n\nUpper Fish Creek and it's tributaries.  The tributaries include Gooseberry Creek, Silver Creek, C Canyon, and the Straight Fork.  This is a roadless area on the north end of the unit.  This area has had some prescribed fires recently that has improved deer habitat.  It can be accessed from North Skyline Drive on the west or from Scofield Reservoir on the east.  The bottom two miles of Upper Fish Creek is privately owned and in a CWMU\nBear Ridge and Fish Creek Ridge  These ridges have roads going down them.  They are northwest of Scofield Reservoir.   The bottom 2 miles of these ridges are privately owned.  This is excellent habitat in the Pondtown Creek drainage on the north end of the unit.  It is best accessed from North Skyline Drive.\nTrough Spring Ridge  This is accessed off of SR-264 southwest of the town of Scofield.  It is just above the Skyline Coal Mine.  This is the ridge on the east side of Electric Lake.  There are some small pockets of private land that are posted well but the majority of the acreage is Forest Service.  Much of this ridge burned in the Seeley Wildfire in 2012 which has improved the deer habitat in this area.\nGentry Mountain.  This is accessed from SR-10 just north of the town of Huntington at Huntington Reservoir.  Part of this mountain is privately owned and part of it burned in the Seeley Wildfire in 2012\nWest of Skyline Drive All the small towns along the west face of the Central Mountains Manti Unit has a canyon road to connect to Skyline Drive.  Some roads are fairly rough going with the better access up from Fairview, Ephraim and Mayfiled.  Concentrate on side roads and trails from the main canyon roads to get to the more likely areas to find deer.  The higher elevations in aspen and sagebrush meadows with water in close proximity will hold some of the mature bucks.  Down low in the agricultural valleys many younger bucks will use the alfalfa fields in the evenings and early morning. Much of the adjacent property along the agriculture is either Forest Service or State lands and there will be a good  opportunities there.\nEast of Skyline Drive and South of Huntington Canyon There is a considerable amount of access along Skyline Drive, high elevation ridge tops, and lower canyons and valleys. There are also many areas where you can hike to get away from roads, much of it very steep, but where nice bucks hold up.  Some preliminary scouting with maps is a great way to familiarize yourself with the unit. One of the best options is Google Earth which you can use to really narrow down an area where you might want to start scouting.  Th",
