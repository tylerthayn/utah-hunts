Before snow falls on the unit you can access the top of the mountain from Antimony, or Cottonwood Creek in Johns Valley. Deer in the summer can be found across the unit in higher and lower elevations. There is good access on most of the BLM lands across the unit, but a lot of the forest service has limited access. There is good access on the south end of the unit in the Hunt Creeks, and often holds deer year round. There was a large fire that burned on the unit in 2002. This made it very good for glassing long distances. There is a lot of pinon and juniper in the lower elevations with Aspen, and mixed conifer stands at higher elevations. During summer months find water and hunt areas around it. ",
