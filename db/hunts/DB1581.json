			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit however, every year a few nice bucks are taken.  The unit population has been increasing over the past few years, along with the buck to doe ratio.  Hunters should be aware of the Ute Tribal Lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on Tribal Lands.  There are 3 CWMUs on this unit, which general season permits are not permitted.  A list of all CWMUs is available on the UDWR webpage: <a href=\"http://wildlife.utah.gov/maps/public/list_cwmus.php\" target=\"_blank\">http://wildlife.utah.gov/maps/public/list_cwmus.php</a>",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Flash floods and lightning strikes are very likely during inclement weather, make sure to watch the sky and plan accordingly.  Always let somebody know where you'll be, and when you expect to be back.  Cell phone service is somewhat limited throughout the unit.  Black bears are regularly seen on the Abajos.  Keep a clean camp and make sure to place all food and garbage in locations that bears cannot get into.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges and flash floods in the canyon bottoms.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The Mule deer on the Abajos typically leave the higher elevations during mid to late fall and head for the winter range at lower elevations.  Winter range occurs in all directions from the mountain range.  In mid to late spring, the deer tend to follow the green-up of grasses/forbs and head back to higher elevations. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Start scouting in late July early August, most deer will be up high and typically seen feeding in large meadows early in the mornings and just before dark.  The deer may not be in the same place during the any weapon hunt, but early scouting will give you an idea of what kind of bucks are on the unit. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points.\nTypically, bucks will be in bachelor groups from early to late summer.  Once the rut starts, bucks will be found with and around does.  Yearling bucks can be found year-round with does, or in bachelor groups.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Mule deer rut:</u> The mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect these hunts.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas for the San Juan, Abajo subunit:</u>\n<br>\n\n<i>Abajo Mountain</i>- Muzzleloader hunters may find bucks in the high country, but should also focus on mid elevations.  Look for oak-brush stands or sagebrush parks, surrounded by pinyon/juniper communities.",
