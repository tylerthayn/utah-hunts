The project area is located in Utah County, approximately 30 miles east southeast of Spanish Fork, Utah, and northwest of Soldier Summit from Highway 6.

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nDeer on this unit migrate down in elevation for the winter and typically from West to East, with most of the deer wintering on or near Tabby WMA.  \n<br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n\n<br>\n\n<u>\nRecommended areas to hunt:</u>\nThere are numerous areas to hunt on this unit. \n<br>\n\nThe areas surrounding Strawberry Reservoir and Currant Creek Reservoir are excellent for deer hunting. They are easy to access with many roads and trails and camping areas. This of course leads to many people hunting these areas. There are very few areas on this unit without a road in the general area. There is far less hunting pressure on the Avintaquin unit, but that is because the overall deer density is much lower and the terrain is more rugged. This unit has very large aspen stands that hold a lot of deer in the early fall. Many of the best bucks taken each year come from these aspen stands. In the summer there are deer in the more open higher areas, but once they get pressured by hunters they will move into the lower, thicker aspen stands. These areas are difficult to hunt, because of the leaves on the trees and fewer open areas to glass with optics. There are also many lower areas with several different browse species, including; oak brush, service berry, mountain mahogany, bitter brush, snow berry, sage brush, etc. These areas also have deer in them during the hunt, but at a lower density. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nSome areas to hunt include the following: \n<br>\n\nCurrant Creek Reservoir Area - high elevation, large aspen stands, very accessible, high deer density for the unit.\n<br>\n\nLow Pass Creek- near Currant Creek Reservoir, rough road, great for ATV’s, great for glassing up high.\n<br>\n\nWest Fork of the Duchesne- limited ATV access, but open to trucks.\n<br>\n\nChicken Creek/Race Track- popular area, but holds a lot of deer and bucks\n<br>\n\nCO-OP Creek –Very Popular area, near Highway 40, great camping, large aspen stands\n<br>\n\nTrout Creek- many bucks taken here opening weekend \n<br>\n\nWildcat WMA – good access, flat on top, a lot of pressure, many yearling bucks taken here.\n<br>\n\nNorth Fork of Deep Creek – borders private land, limited access by road, great horse area\n<br>\n\nTabby Mountain – great for ATV’s, better after snow storms, mostly public land.\n<br>\n\nColeman Basin/Red Creek Mtn- SITLA land, some areas without roads, rough roads\n<br>\n\nReservation Ridge –fewer deer, but fewer people\n<br>\n\nStrawberry Peak- High elevation, large areas near by with no road access, Cow Hollow, Slab Canyon, low deer density\n<br>\n\nTimber Canyon/Long Ridge- low deer density, rough terrain, better after storms, rough roads. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Dollar Ridge Fire Update</b> – July 2018<br><br>\n\n\nIn early July 2018 the Dollar Ridge Fire burned approximately 50,000 acres on the Avintaquin and Currant Creek subunits of the Wasatch Mountains unit. The fire started in the Strawberry River Corridor and areas burned include portions of the Strawberry River wildlife management area and the Wildcat wildlife management area. Wildfire can have both negative and positive consequences for habitat and wildlife. In the right circumstances, wildfire can be a very effective tool for improving wildlife habitat. At lower elevation winter ranges fire may be detrimental if it removes important wintering feed sources or opens a niche for invasive weeds. In mid to high elevations fire often removes old, decadent growth and allows for new plants with high nutritional value. Grasses and forbs with high nutritional value are usually the first plant communities to come back after a fire. Regeneration in aspen stands is triggered by fire and mountain browse communities are quick to rebound.<br><br>\n\n \nThis fire mostly occurred in higher summer and transition ranges for big game. Based on current burned locations, we anticipate the effects of the Dollar Ridge Fire to be mostly positive for deer, elk and moose. We have observed that GPS collared moose and elk in the burn temporarily moved to adjacent habitats while the fire was actively burning, then moved back almost immediately after the active fire subsided. If we receive our normal late-summer monsoon weather pattern it is very likely the burned areas will have a flush of new growth or “green-up” prior to the hunting season.<br><br>\n\n \nWildfire can change wildlife distribution. Removal of cover may make an area less desirable for wary animals. Conversely, a good fall green-up might actually pull animals out of adjacent areas into the newly burned areas. Don’t overlook burned areas when hunting as they can be good places to locate game.<br><br>\n\n\nIn 2017 the Brian Head fire burned 71,000 acres, nearly 25% of the Panguitch unit. At the end of the 2017 hunting season there were very few complaints from hunters and hunter success rates were normal to above normal. The Wasatch is a large unit and there are many locations with good hunting that were not affected by the Dollar Ridge Fire. We anticipate good opportunities for sportsmen this fall despite disturbance from the fire. In the long term we expect wildlife to reap many benefits from this fire.\n",
