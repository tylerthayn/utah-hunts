			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Most hunters plan on spending at least 3-4 days hunting.  There are few water sources so plan on bringing extra water in with you. Foot hunters who plan to hunt in the upper elevations should plan on staying up there for several days. It is just too far to come down every day.  I would plan on a very challenging and rewarding hunt. Review your maps frequently to avoid trespass issues on the Goshutes.\n\nThis area is patrolled quite frequently by DWR and BLM personnel.  Keep this in mind when you are transporting your game and driving an ATV.  Try to make it easy to access the permit and tag on the animal.  \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with limited access.  Cellular phones will not work.  Digital cell phones may show a bar but will not connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The Biologist suggests handheld radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return. Bring an extra spare tire, water and gas. There are not facilities. Wendover is the closest (60 miles).",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with meat spoiling in the heat.  I would plan on hot weather and plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This unit has a low deer population and is very remote with extreme topography. This is a very difficult unit to find deer. If you never have seen the Deep Creeks you better go look before your hunt.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting deer in this area.  Scouting is most effective mid-summer.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bucks along with everyone else. This is a popular unit to put cameras out.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset)unless pressured. <br>\n    \nUpper elevations deer spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.        \n\nI would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area. Consult with the Goshute Reservation for info on the reservation boundaries. The reservation expanded  a few years ago and the public maps are not up to date.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.\n",
