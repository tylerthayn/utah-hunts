			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Fish Lake unit is a general season hunt unit and is managed to provide deer hunting opportunity. The unit is excellent deer habitat and is a popular place to hunt. In recent years, due to drought and a harsh winter this unit experienced lower than normal fawn production and survival resulting in a decline in population and buck/doe ratios. Buck permit numbers have been reduced to compensate. However, deer hunting has been fair/good. Though not managed as a trophy unit, hunters still have reasonable opportunity to find mature bucks.<br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis hunt is overlapped by the general season, spike elk season. Deer hunters should expect to run into many elk hunters.\n<br>\n<br>\n  \nDeer populate the entire unit and can move in response to hunting pressure and weather. Elevations range from 5,000 ft valleys to peaks over 11,000 ft. Vegetation communities range from sagebrush, pinyon/juniper, to aspen/conifer.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "<u>Weather Conditions:</u> The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for hot & dry, or rainy, lightening, windy or even snowy conditions.  Early snow storms sometimes occur during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.  During the archery season hunters should be prepared to cool harvested game quickly due to warm temperatures.",

The unit is excellent deer habitat and is a popular place to hunt. In recent years, due to drought and a harsh winter this unit experienced lower than normal fawn production and survival resulting in a decline in population and buck/doe ratios. Buck permit numbers have been reduced to compensate. <br>\n<br>\n \nDeer populate the entire unit and can move in response to hunting pressure and weather. Elevations range from 5,000 ft valleys to peaks over 11,000 ft. Vegetation communities range from sagebrush, pinyon/juniper, to aspen/conifer.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Any Weapon Early Season:</u>\nIn early October the deer on the Fish Lake unit tend to be very spread out. During this season there could be deer near 11,000 ft elevation or as low as the valley floors. Hunter pressure will be high due to the high number of spike elk hunters who's hunt overlaps this hunt. Deer hunters may be able to get way from elk hunting pressured areas by hunting where there tends to be fewer elk. Many of the bucks will still be in Bachelor groups, as the rut is still several weeks away.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nSome of the deer on Fish Lake unit begin to migrate to or closer to their winter range in mid-October. By the time the rifle hunt arrives a sizable portion of the herd is often in the transitional ranges between their winter and summer ranges. However many deer also stay as high as they can until heavy snows push them lower. Most of the migration is rather simple, the deer just move up or down in elevation. However there are some deer that move from their summering areas on the North and Central parts of the unit to the Southern, Eastern, and Western parts of the unit closer to their winter range.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Mule Deer rut:</u> The mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it generally does not affect the general deer hunts.\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas to hunt on the Fish Lake unit:</u>\nThere are deer spread across the entire Fish Lake unit. During the archery and muzzleloader hunts concentrate in areas above 8,000 ft.  During the any-weapon hunt the deer are spread from the top of the mountain to the valley floors. Every year a few older age class bucks are taken. There is no single area that produces more than others. The key is to scout your areas before the hunt to look for the deer you want.",
