			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Nebo unit has some very rough terrain. I tell hunters that \"the Nebo is either strait up or strait down\" so be prepared for some very hard work. ATV use is not allowed on the north Nebo and horses or mules are recommended. At the very  least hunters should be in very good physical condition. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Depending on the season be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road and trail conditions.  Most hunters struggle with meat spoiling in the heat especially during the archery season so in anticipation of hot weather plan accordingly.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "33.3~14000~13500~15–17~16.5~~~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "In the past the harvest has been distributed throughout the entire portion of the Nebo.  The higher elevations can be good places to start looking for more mature bucks but  the younger bucks can be found at lower elevations, especially associated with agriculture areas. Don’t limit yourself to a few areas. They can be found anywhere on the mountains. Some of the areas to concentrate on are Nebo Creek, Page Fork, Hop Creek, and Mahogany Knoll.  Other good places are off the Nebo Loop Road around Payson Lakes and the Summit Trail.  The south Nebo (Sanpitch Mts.), that portion of the Nebo Unit that is south of SR 132, may be more accessible since ATV use is allowed by the USFS. However there is private property further south as well as a CWMU deer unit.\n<br>\n\nWater sources are good places to find deer.  Most archery hunters have the most success early in the hunt sitting at remote water holes and canyons with perennial water.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u> There is very little deer migration during the archery and muzzleloader hunt.  Deer remain on summer ranges typically at 7,500 feet and above.  When migration begins (typically in mid October to mid-December) deer move down in elevation to the sagebrush benches which is usually after the rifle hunt.  However, heavy snow fall during the hunt may cause deer to migrate to lower elevations early.\n<br>\n<br>\n \n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Good hunters will scout and find their own \"honey hole\".  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting deer in this area.  Scouting is most effective mid-summer.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of deer.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset).  There are very few signs on the trails.  I would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.  \n",
