			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<Most deer on the Tavaputs Plateau migrate to the east toward the Green River to spend the winter months.  This includes the lower ends of Ceder, Cottonwood, and Flat Iron Ridges as well as the area near Prickly Pear Canyon.  Deer on the western part of the unit tend to migrate to the southwest to the foothills just north and east of Price near the Price Airport, Coal Creek, and Soldier Creek.  Deer tend to be moving on to transitional habitats during the any weapon deer hunt each year by midweek.  Hunting is much better if the weather is bad and generally poor if we have had mild weather. <br>\n<br>\n \n\n<u>Mule Deer Rut:\n</u>The mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended Areas to Hunt:</u> The Cold Springs WMA provides good public land access on high elevation summer habitat and transitional fall habitat near Bruin Point.  There is a county road through the middle of the WMA with over 2500 acres of public lands available.  Much of the property is walk-in only to maintain quality deer hunting in the area.  This area can be accessed from Bruin Point near Sunnyside or if the weather is bad from Nine Mile Canyon and up Cottonwood Canyon.  Lots of wild horses on this part of the mountain.\n<br>\n\nUpper Patmos Ridge/Range Creek - There are 5 sections of BLM land that are surrounded by private lands just south of Bruin Point and North of the Preston Nutter Ranch gate.  This provides good deer habitat at high elevations on steep timber covered terrain with ample water.  This is accessed from Bruin Point near Sunnyside.\n<br>\n\nHarmon Canyon/Prickly Pear Canyon - This is good transitional habitat especially if there has been some snow.  It is accessed via Nine Mile Canyon then you can drive up the Harmon Canyon road which is about 30 miles east of Wellington Utah.  These are sagebrush/PJ habitats at about 7500 feet in elevation.\n<br>\nCottonwood/Ceder Ridge - This is good transitional habitat in sagebrush at elevations of 6500 to 8000 feet.  There are private lands to the west but plenty of public lands as you go down the ridges.  These areas are accessed via Nine Mile Canyon and then Cottonwood Canyon 45 miles east of Wellington.  \n<br>\nAirport Road/Coal Creek/Soldier Creek - These are the low elevation benches that concentrate deer if there has been a significant snowstorm in October.  They are the foothills just north and east of the towns of Price and Wellington.  Hunting is generally poor if the weather is mild and can be good after a snowstorm.  They are mostly public lands.<br>\n<br>b>Anthro Subunit</b><br>\nRecommended areas to hunt:\n\nThe Anthro subunit has very low deer densities. It can be a very difficult hunt. You may go several days without seeing a deer. Because the density is so low, if you do find any bucks, there is a good chance of it being a mature buck. There is a lot of area East of Antelope Canyon all the way to the Green River, with even lower deer densities, while hunting these areas your best chance is finding water. There are several guzzlers and springs in this desert area, but even around these water sources there are very few deer. Some good areas to hunt are the following: \n\nNutter’s Ridge – USFS higher elevation, a few large aspen stands, very accessible\n\nJeep Trail Ridge – USFS just East of Nutter’s Ridge, large canyons with a few aspens, several water sources\n\nWire Fence Ridge- USFS rough road, biggest aspen stands on Anthro, good burned side hills \n\nAlkaline/Choke Cherry- USFS very open country, few deer, East of Jeep Trail\n\nWells Draw –BLM lands, low elevation pinyon/juniper, low density\n\nCottonwood Ridge- USFS difficult access, higher elevation, many timbered hill sides \n   \n",

On this part of the unit there are only small isolated parcels of public lands on summer ranges to hunt.  Prior permission must be secured before hunting on private lands.

There is a mix of USFS and BLM lands in this area although wildlife densities tend to be lower in this area.<br>\n<br>\n\n<i>Anthro Subunit</i><br>\nPublic, Private and Tribal Lands.  The public lands are primarily US Forest Service lands managed by the Ashley National Forest and The Bureau of Land Management(BLM) managed out of the Vernal Field Office.  This unit also includes large tracks of Ute Tribal lands that are closed to non-tribal members. The Tribal lands are mostly on the North end of the unit in the pinyon/juniper belt, with heavy oil field activity. The private land on the unit is primarily North of the Tribal boundary and in the low elevation desert areas and agricultural lands. There are two CWMU's on the unit (Antelope Creek and Cottonwood Ridge). <br>\n<br>\nRange Creek Subunit<br>\nMost of the high elevation summer and early fall habitat is privately owned.  Much of this private land occurs on 5 CWMU's (Preston Nutter Ranch, Patmos Ridge, Roan Cliffs, Conover-Jensen, and Minnie Maud CWMU's).  Public lands occur at mid elevations and on the winter range.
