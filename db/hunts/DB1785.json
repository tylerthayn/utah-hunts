			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  Deer habitat includes a lot of public land but there is substantial habitat on private lands throughout the unit. Hunters should be aware of the private lands and learn the boundaries.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety beyond a cellphone.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nPlan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two.  Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Panguitch Lake unit has a healthy deer population.  Expect to see several bucks each day, with the majority probably being young deer.  To increase your chances of seeing deer it is best to find water in good deer habitat. During the archery and muzzleloader hunts most deer are on summer range with some deer in year round range that may be at lower elevations. Good numbers of deer exist on USFS lands and areas close to Brian Head and Cedar Breaks National Monument will generally see the heaviest hunting pressure.  During the rifle hunt most deer are in transition to their wintering habitat.  Some deer will still be higher on Forest Service and Private lands, but many may be on the lower elevation BLM and private lands.  The eastern portion will still have good numbers of deer on USFS lands and will generally see the heaviest hunting pressure.  Some good areas to hunt include Hatch Mountain, Pole Hollow/5 Mile, 3 Mile Creek, Bear Valley, Buckskin Valley, Cottonwood, and all areas along I-15. \n\n\nMigration Patterns:  \nThe migratory segments of this population may begin their fall movements in late September and October.  Migration from summer ranges may be dependent on fall storms and weather conditions.    \n\nScouting Tips:\nA good spotting scope and binoculars can be helpful if you are unfamiliar with the area.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate public lands and access points.   \n",
