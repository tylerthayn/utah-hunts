			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few really nice bucks are taken.  Hunters should be aware of the Ute Tribal Lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on Tribal Lands.  There are no CWMUs on this unit.  The Uintah Mountain range can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but there are also less deer.  Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for deer.  It is generally Lodge Pole Pine without much of an understory.  \nRoad access is allowed on the majority of the unit.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two.  Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  \n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Migration Patterns:\nDeer on this unit migrate down in elevation for the winter and tend to stay on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  \n\nMule Deer rut:\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not affect this hunt.  \n\nRecommended areas in the South Slope, Vernal:\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. \n\nThere is a variety of habitat to hunt during the muzzleloader hunt.  There is pinyon/juniper, sage brush savanna, thick lodge pole pine, and above timber line.  The larger openings on the forest are called parks and can be found on most maps but the smaller openings are scattered across the high country.  If you choose to hunt the high country, be prepared for unpredictable weather and rocky terrain.\n\nDuring the hunts most of the deer on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes with sagebrush and conifer.  That zone across the South Slope is the most productive for deer.  \nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit:\n\nWhiterocks Canyon – Whiterocks River is the western unit boundary, steep terrain.\nParadise Park-Higher forest terrain, steep forested canyons.\nMosby Mountain-High aspen forest, with large sagebrush bowls, excellent habitat.  \nRed Cloud Loop Rd-Long road that starts in Dry Fork Canyon (west of Vernal).  It takes you all the way through the Vernal unit, and comes out on Hwy 191..  \nTaylor Mountain-Great vantage points.  Excellent area to glass and locate animals from far distances. \nColton Ranger Station-Aspen/conifer mix forest.\nLime Stone, Little V, and Range Study-These areas are east of Hwy 191 and border a limited entry deer and elk unit.  Diamond Mountain.\n \n",
