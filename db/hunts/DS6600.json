			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Bighorn sheep population on the Henry's unit is stable to increasing. This is an incredibly beautiful place to hunt but it is a difficult hunt. The sheep are estimated to be about 100 in number and spread over a lot of area with little access from North Wash on the north to Good Hope Mesa on the south.  Within this area sheep are located at times along Lake Powell and the mesas and canyon drainages of Trachyte, Two Mile, Four Mile, Peshliki, and Ticaboo. They are also found on Mt Ellsworth, Mt. Holmes, and Mt. Hillers. The information on this webpage is meant to help guide you to areas that are likely to have sheep based upon harvest and observations, as well as other information to help you be successful on your hunt.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Sheep habitat is found between 3700' to 8500' and about 85 square miles on this unit. Hunters should be in excellent physical condition prior to the hunt as most hunters end up walking dozens of miles and traversing thousands of feet in elevation prior to harvesting their ram. As with most bighorn sheep habitat, there are steep impassible canyons and an abundance of cliffs. Be very careful scaling cliffs. It is advised that you bring extra rope and climbing gear to assist with getting through difficult ledges. A GPS unit is very handy on this unit to not only mark sheep and routes but also places where you can get through the ledges as they are relatively rare. Hunters can sometimes spend hours hiking along trying to find a way through the ledges and wasting time and energy. Bring plenty of water, there is very little on the unit.  Carry a good survival kit and a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp, where you are hunting, and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Temperatures can swing dramatically in November, be prepared for all weather conditions, pay attention to the weather forecast and use common sense.  Generally, plan on cold nights with mild days and little to no snow accumulation. Snow and bad weather is always possible in November. Be cautious of flash flooding during rain and thunder storms.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u><b>Suggested Hunting Area:</b></u> Higher unit densities of desert bighorns based upon harvest and observations- between Ticaboo Creek and Four Mile Canyon, Trachyte Point above North Wash, and the east side of Mt Hillers. Lower densities areas- along the Lake Powell, on Mt. Ellsworth and Mt. Holmes, Maidenwater, Woodruff Canyon, Two Mile Canyon and associated canyon plateaus. Sheep often use cliff bands and the grassy benches between them, the rims of canyons, and the canyon bottoms. They are also often seen in the slick rock areas.<br>\n<br>\n<u><b>Scouting Tips:</b></u> It’s good to be familiar with the area and understand if you have what it will take to find and harvest a mature ram before applying for this permit. You will need a good pair of binoculars and a good spotting scope. During the summer you will most likely see groups of ewes, lambs, and young rams. Older rams generally will not move into the area where the ewe groups are until the rut begins in late October. Hunting generally gets better the later you go with more mature rams showing up by November. Rams move a lot in November between ewe groups, so a single group  of ewes and lambs can attract different rams from day to day.<br>\n<br>\n<u><b>Behavior:</b></u> The peak of the rut tends to be the week of Thanksgiving or just prior to it. Rams will be moving from group to group looking for ewes. It is difficult to glass up rams but sometimes you can hear them butting heads as they compete with other rams to breed with the ewes. This can sound like a rifle firing through the canyons if you’re close enough. Sheep are generally active throughout the day in November but activity is highest in morning and evening. Bighorn sheep can go long periods without drinking water, acquiring moisture from vegetation that they eat. Bighorn will generally avoid the flat mesa tops where there is tree cover, but not always. Sheep use precipitous canyons and plateaus where the topography is steep with rough rocky outcrops. Between canyon ledges are often wider grassy slopes and shelves where sheep feed and which are corridors to other canyon layers and escape routes. Desert bighorn sheep have cloven hooves with harder sides/edges and softer inner pads. This adaptation allows them to quickly traverse steep rocky terrain to avoid predation. They are good at hiding under tight ledges and rocks.<br>\n<br>\n<u><b>Horn Growth:</b></u> Both rams and ewes have horns. Mature ram horns are much larger than ewe horns and will form a curl. Mature ewes and yearling rams have similar curl; however, a ewe horn is thin and a yearling ram horn is much heavier especially at the base. 2.5 year old rams begin to have a pronounced curl, and rams that are 3 to 5 years old will have plenty of horn length but the horn tips are very thin. The best way to recognize mature trophy class bighorn rams is to look for horns closer to a full curl with horn mass, particularly out near the end of the horn. Mature rams 6 years and older have thicker heavier bases and the horns are thicker out near the ends only because older rams ‘broom off’ the thinner tips. During the rut horn growth nearly stops, creating annuli growth rings on the horn. The rate at which the horn grows in length steadily declines after 3.5 years of age, after about 8.5 years growth rings become less defined and their reliability to determine age drops dramatically. Often times if you are close enough, you can count horn rings on rams to get an approximate age. If you know the horn is broomed and heavy at the end then the second growth ring you see is most likely at 2.5 years old. The 2.5 yr and 3.5 year rings are often the most prominent with the 3.5 yr old ring being the deepest because it is associated with the ram’s first rut. The ear will usually point to this ring on a mature ram. If only one prominent ring is seen it is probably a 2.5 year old ram. By locating the 3.5 yr old ring you can determine or at least estimate the age of the ram by adding a year for each subsequent annuli growth ring.<br>\n<br>\nDisease Issues: Bighorn sheep are highly susceptible to infection from respiratory pathogens. Between 30-70% of the herd can die if they become infected, and lambs born into the herd can continue to die after an outbreak. Bighorn sheep usually become infected through contact with domestic sheep or goats. These domestic animals carry the disease but aren't affected by it. While you are out scouting and hunting please report precise locations and numbers of any domestic sheep or goats in bighorn habitat to the local DWR office.",
