			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The highest densities of bighorn on the Kaiparowits, Escalante can be found within a few miles along the shorelines of Lake Powell and the Escalante river; however sheep can also be found well into the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument.  This herd has received several transplants in recent years to augment the existing population so observing a sheep with a radio collar and/or an ear tag is possible.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nSome high use areas include areas surrounding Stevens Canyon and the Moody's.  Bighorn are often observed near shore of Lake Powell in canyons east and west of the Escalante River.  Areas north of the lake where sheep are commonly found include the canyons east of the Hole in the Rock road east to Halls Creek.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThis species lives in extreme rugged habitat that can have extreme weather conditions.  Be prepared to hike in this type of country and spend a lot of time with your binoculars.   ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Kaiparowits unit offers some truck and ATV access which is highly dependent on weather.  Roads are often washed out by heavy rains and an ATV may be most useful to access many areas.  Much of this area is inaccessible during wet conditions so watch weather forecasts.  A 4WD vehicle is highly recommended.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nCellular phone coverage is spotty but a call or text can usually be made if you are in a spot where you can see Navajo Mountain which is the big rounded mountain on the south side of Lake Powell.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nPlan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and hot conditions.  Storms WILL cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "100~400~255~~~~~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest: </u> Harvest locations can vary by hunter abilities and preferences.  If an accessible area by vehicle and day hike trip is desired, focus on the areas by the Middle Moody trailhead.  If a hunt by boat is desired, focus efforts near the Escalante River.  Any of these areas can offer a great backpack trip with great scenery.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>  Bighorn sheep seem to limit movements in the hottest times of the year with trips to watering areas highly documented.  Space use increases as rutting behaviors begin.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\nScouting Tips:</u>\n\nMost hunters spend a substantial amount of time becoming familiar with maps of this area and spend time prior to the hunt to locate areas with sheep.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential to bighorn sheep hunting.  Find a high point, get comfortable, and spend time glassing to locate sheep. Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens but can offer great insight at any time of the year.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate springs and guzzlers in the more arid areas of the unit.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>  Peak rutting behavior appears to occur in October and November.  There is more water available on this unit than one would think.  Be aware of small seeps, rock tanks and springs and look for tracks since sheep may use watering areas regularly.  \n",
