			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Most areas occupied by bighorn sheep on the Kaiparowits West can be found on the cliffs of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument near Big Water, UT.  This herd extends from the Paria River east to the unit boundary on the Smokey Mountain.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nSome high use areas on this unit include the Paria River from Kitchen Canyon south to the Cockscomb.  Bighorn are also often observed along the cliffs of Brigham Plains, Jack Riggs Bench and in the upper terraces from Coyote Point east to Wahweap Creek.  All the side canyons off Nipple Bench are occupied.  Lower densities exist in the John Henry and Wesses Canyon areas and densities increase again to the east on Smokey Mountain. Sheep are often seen crossing the unit boundary near Wiregrass and Crosby Canyons where they may be moving to and from areas closer to Lake Powell.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nTo avoid contact with domestic sheep and disease transmission, bighorn are not promoted west of Kitchen Corral to the unit boundary of Johnson Canyon.  Observing sheep in Johnson Canyon should be reported to the Cedar City UDWR office.  Some research on this herd has occurred recently so observing a sheep with a radio collar and/or an ear tag is possible.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThis species lives in extreme rugged habitat that can have extreme weather conditions.  Be prepared to hike in this type of country and spend a lot of time with your binoculars.   \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Kaiparowits West unit offers decent truck and ATV access but is highly dependent on weather.  Roads may be washed out by heavy rains and an ATV may be most useful to access many areas.  Much of this area is inaccessible during wet conditions so watch weather forecasts.  A 4WD vehicle is highly recommended.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nCellular phone coverage is spotty but a call or text can usually be made if you are in a spot where you can see Navajo Mountain which is the big rounded mountain on the south side of Lake Powell.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nPlan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and hot conditions.  Storms WILL cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>  Harvest locations can vary by hunter abilities and preferences.  It is common for hunters to get to the top of many of these areas and glass down the canyons to locate sheep.  Brigham Plains, Nipple Bench, and Smokey Mountain offer great opportunities for this strategy.  \n<br>\n\nAny of these areas can also offer a great backpack trip with great scenery.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>  Bighorn sheep seem to limit movements in the hottest times of the year with trips to watering areas highly documented.  Space use increases as rutting behaviors begin.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\n\nMost hunters spend a substantial amount of time becoming familiar with maps of this area and spend time prior to the hunt to locate areas with sheep.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential to bighorn sheep hunting.  Find a high point, get comfortable, and spend time glassing to locate sheep. Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens but can offer great insight at any time of the year.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate springs and guzzlers in the more arid areas of the unit.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>  Peak rutting behavior appears to occur in October and November.  There is more water available on this unit than one would think.  Be aware of small seeps and springs and look for tracks since sheep may use watering areas regularly.  \n",
