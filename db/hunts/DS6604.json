			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt has something to offer every level of hunter looking to harvest a Desert Bighorn Sheep.  There are sheep areas that are easily accessible, as well as very remote areas.  Harvest success is typically high, with descent rams harvested each year.  This is some of the most beautiful sheep country in the state and is in close proximity to Moab.  Mandatory online harvest reporting is required.  Animal needs to be checked in at office with a conservation officer or biologist, to plug the horns.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This unit is steep and rough with very little cell coverage.  As in most bighorn sheep habitat, hunters should be in excellent physical condition prior to the hunt as most hunters end up walking dozens of miles and climbing thousands of feet prior to harvesting their ram.  As with most bighorn sheep habitat, there is an abundance of cliffs.  Be very careful scaling cliffs.  It is advised that you bring extra rope to assist with getting through difficult ledges.   A GPS unit is very handy on this unit to not only mark sheep and routes but also places where you can get through the ledges as they are relatively rare.  Hunters can sometimes spend hours hiking along trying to find a way through the ledges and wasting time and energy.  Bring plenty of water.  It can be warm in November and there is very little water on the unit.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Weather conditions in November are variable on this unit.  Generally, plan on cold nights with mild days and little to no snow accumulation.  Most of the occupied bighorn sheep habitat occurs at lower elevations between 4200 and 6000 feet where snow generally doesn't accumulate.  Snow and bad weather is always possible in November.  Be cautious of flash flooding during rain storms.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>\nThe majority of the bighorn sheep observed on this unit are found within 2 miles of the Colorado and Green Rivers.  Sheep use the cliff bands above the river and on mesa slopes, as well as, the grassy benches between them.  East Schafer Cyn., Big Chief, Mineral Cyn., Hell Roaring Cyn. and under Dead Horse Pnt. are all good locations to locate bighorn.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\nIt is good to do pre-season scouting to learn the country.  However, it is very hot on this unit during the summer months so plan accordingly.  You will need a good pair of binoculars and a spotting scope.  The unit is dry and rocky/cliffy.  During the summer you will most likely see groups of ewes, lambs, and young rams.  Some of the larger, harvestable rams will not move on to public lands and be available for harvest until the rut begins in late October.  Do not be alarmed if there are no big rams in the summer.  They will show up by November.  Hunting generally gets better the later you go.  The peak of the rut tends to be the week of Thanksgiving.  Find groups of ewes and lambs and often times a new ram will be with the ewe group each day as rams are moving a lot in November between ewe groups.  \n<br>\n\nA way to cover lots of ground is to hike up on top of a canyon and glass the other side while having someone else hike the other side of the canyon and look back across the canyon toward you.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>\nThe month of November is during the bighorn sheep rut.  Rams are moving from group to group looking for ewes.  Rams can also be observed butting heads.  It is advised to occasionally stop and listen for the sound of butting heads it can be a good tool for locating sheep that are otherwise difficult to see.  Sheep are generally active throughout the day in November but activity is highest in morning and evening.  Bighorn sheep will not be as tied to water in November as it is generally more available that time of year if it has snowed.  Bighorn will generally avoid the flat mesa top areas where there is any sort of tree cover.  They tend to be found on the steep open cliffs and are occasionally are feeding on the flat canyon bottoms or benches.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<u>Ram vs Ewe:</u>\nBoth rams and ewes have horns.  Ram horns are much larger than ewe horns and will form a curl.  Many young rams will have a pronounced curl.  The best way to recognize mature trophy class bighorn rams is to look for horn mass, particularly out near the tip of the horn.  Younger rams that are 3 to 5 years old will have plenty of horn length but the horn tips are very thin.  Mature rams 6 years and older tend to have thicker horns out near the tips, and thicker bases.  Often times if you are close enough you can count horn rings on rams to get an approximate age.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Desert Bighorn Sheep rut:</u>\nThe bighorn rut runs during late October and extends through early December with the peak being around Thanksgiving.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Where to find Desert Bighorn Sheep:</u>\nFocus on the steep side slopes of mesa's.  Bighorns will generally be found on the rocky slopes, but occasionally can be seen in the grassy canyon bottoms.  Mineral, East Schafer, Big Chief, below Dead Horse Pnt. and Hell Roaring canyons can all be good areas to check.\n",
