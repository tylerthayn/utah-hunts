This hunt coincides with the Virgin River sub-unit to the south. Please make sure you know your boundaries. The nearest developed camp ground is located at Gunlock State Park. Camping on BLM land is limited to 14 days in any one location.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "As with most sheep habitat the terrain is extremely rugged.  Make sure you are ready physically and have good hiking boots. Cell phone service is spotty.  Make sure friends and family know where you are hunting and when to expect you to return. Carry plenty of water.  Day time temps are still very warm for this November-December hunt time frame. Hunting in pairs is a good idea.",
