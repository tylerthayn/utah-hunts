Hunting is generally poor until there have been several snowstorms.  When there has been significant snowfall on the winter range, elk can be found at low elevations across the Gordon Creek WMA.  Elk are often found on public lands near the Gordon Creek fields at the upper reaches of the Consumer's Road as well as on Cedar, Telephone, Horse, Wiregrass, and Long Benches.  On years where there is little snow, hunting is much more difficult.  Elk will remain at as high an elevation as possible on this unit.  Much of the higher elevation transitional habitat is on private lands near Scofield Reservoir.  During these light winters, hunters can have some moderate success by hunting the Ford Ridge Road off of SR-6 at the top of Price Canyon as well as hiking up some of the tributaries of Gordon Creek such as Bob Wright, Second Water, and Corner Canyons.
