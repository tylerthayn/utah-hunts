			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The intent of this late season cow elk hunt is to harvest elk while they are on the winter range and reduce the overall population while also discouraging elk from using nearby farms and haystacks.  On years when snowfall levels are low elk will generally remain at higher elevations and not migrate down to lower winter ranges as expected. This is especially the case in the Stump Flat and Danish bench areas south of SR31 and north of SR29.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a late season hunt.  Expect winter conditions:  very cold weather, snowy roads, steep canyons, and poor cell coverage.  Hunters should dress for very cold conditions. 4 Wheel Drive Vehicles are necessary.  It is highly advised that you pack a set of tire chains with you",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "See above.  Expect winter conditions.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This is a late season hunt.  Success improves substantially once there is substantial snow in the valley.  Hunt success is generally poor when there is no snow as elk remain at high elevations where access is rather difficult.  On years where it snows, good hunting locations include the benches south of the town of Hiawatha, the benches south of the ghost town of Mohrland, as well as several locations south of Huntington Canyon.  When there is very little snow, hunters can try their luck taking the Mohrland Road to the top of Gentry Mountain or taking SR-31 to higher elevation hunting areas such as the Nuck Woodward Canyon Road.  These areas will have very little vehicle access.",
