			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This can be a great hunt, especially if Colorado gets any snow accumulation.  Elk that spend the summer and fall in Colorado will pull down onto the Utah portion of the Dolores Triangle to winter.  Large herds of elk are often seen during this time.  Be cautious of private property, as there are a few good sized ranches on the unit that do not want hunters on their property. If you do get into a large herd of elk, try to pick out a single cow and stick with her until she goes down, do not start flock shooting.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cell phone service is very limited on this unit.  It is a good idea to let someone know where you are and when you will return.  I would recommend having a four-wheel drive vehicle during this hunt, with tire chains or a tow strap, just in case.  Late season snow storms can settle in on this unit, causing some roads to be impassible.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have snow storms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges and flash flooding in the canyon bottoms. ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> This unit is winter range for elk that summer in the Glade Park and Pinon Mesa areas (unit 40) of western Colorado. CDPW biologists estimate the population of unit 40 at 2500-3500 elk. The number of elk that winter in the Dolores Triangle unit is dependent upon winter severity. Winter population numbers have typically varied between 300 and 700 elk. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Start scouting in mid November, many of the elk will be on the subunit by then and it will give you a chance to see how many elk you can expect on your hunt. The subunit is not large and elk scatter across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is primarily when elk feed and can be found out in open meadows.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Elk rut:</u> There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n<u>Recommended areas Dolores Triangle Subunit:</u>\n\n<br>\n<i>Steamboat Mesa</i>- Habitat treatments and fire have occurred in the area, draws a decent number of elk to the area in winter, good place to glass.\n<br>\n<i>Ryan Creek/Granite Creek</i>- Rugged canyon rims, limited access, good place for bulls latter in the year.\n<br>\n<i>Ryan Park</i>- Great area for elk (cows and bulls), good road and many places to glass for game. \n<br>\n<i>Little Dolores</i>- Can hold large herds of elk, good place to glass, bulls and cows found latter in the year.",
