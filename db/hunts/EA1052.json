			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> There are more elk on the Anthro unit in the winter than there are in the summer and early fall. Many elk migrate from surrounding units to winter on the Anthro. Some elk come all the way from the Strawberry Reservoir area. The migration is typically elk coming from the West to winter further East. This migration can start as early as October, after the rut. There is, however, a fair amount of resident elk scattered across the entire unit, even on the desert parts on the East half of the unit. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips: </u>  The unit is large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points. There are many springs and guzzlers on the unit and these are typically the best places to find elk during the summer and fall. This is a general season hunt and is very difficult, success rates are really low. If you plan on hunting this unit, scouting is a must.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. \n<br>\n\nMost spike bulls are with cow and calf herds during the hunts. Keep this in mind as you plan your hunt. There is a lot of pressure put on these elk during the general season hunts, this will push the elk towards private land or areas with difficult access or terrain. After opening morning spend your time hunting the thick timber canyons or large aspen stands. Road hunting is not a very effective method of hunting during the general season.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas Anthro Unit from West to East:</u>\n<br>\n\n<i>Indian Canyon</i>- can only hunt the East side of Highway 191, unless you have the January hunt. Not great during the early seasons, but can be a great place during the later seasons. Steep hillsides, and big canyons. Great place to glass.\n<br>\n\n<i>Cottonwood Ridge</i>- difficult access, better hunting on the late hunts, the best areas are the highest elevation.  \n<br>\n\n<i>Sowers Canyon</i>- good access, many large canyons to glass. During the earlier hunts the far South end of the Canyon is best. The entire canyon is good during the late hunts.\n<br>\n\n<i>Wire Fence Ridge</i>- plenty of road access. Large aspen stands near the top of the ridge, there are also several steep hillsides that have been burned and these areas are great during late summer and early fall. Large sage brush flats, great area to hunt on the later hunts.\n<br>\n\n<i>Nutters Ridge</i>- Main road access for the Anthro Mountain portion of the unit. Very similar to Wire Fence, good aspen stands up high and several water troughs and springs. The far North end of this ridge is currently being drilled heavily for oil, avoid these areas.\n<br>\n\n<i>Jeep Trail</i>- good access, a few good aspen stands and burned areas. The far North end of this ridge also has had substantial drilling activity, with many new roads, elk will avoid these areas. There have been several habitat treatments done in this area.\n<br>\n\n<i>Alkaline/Choke Cherry area</i>- Really open area up high, several springs and guzzlers in this area as well. The open areas can hold many large herds of elk in the late fall and wintert. Lots of road access on small secondary ridges.\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n(Avintaquin unit)\n<br>\n\n<i>Horse Ridge</i>- Large Wildlife Management Area(UDWR property). Large, flat ridges, with steep canyons. Most years, this area is difficult to access in January, good place to hunt on mild winters.\n<br>\n\n<i>Lake Canyon</i>- Another large Wildlife Management Area(UDWR property). All the roads are in the bottom of steep canyons. Great area to hunt when there is deep snow in the higher elevations. Road access is good because of the oil field activity.\n<br>\n\n<i>Right Fork of Indian Canyon</i>- Very similar to Lake Canyon. Very Steep hillsides with roads in the bottom. Must drive through private property to access the Forest Service lands. \n\n",
