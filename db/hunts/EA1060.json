			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt coincides with the general season muzzleloader buck deer hunt.  Elk hunters should expect to see other hunters.  Elk can be found throughout the unit on the Ashley National Forest during this early muzzleloader hunt.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically from year to year.  Be prepared for rain, snow, wind and cold.  Early fall snow storms usually occur in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable or very muddy.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nElk in this unit move back and forth across Wyoming and Utah state lines.  Majority of the elk are up high in elevation during the summer months and will move down in elevation towards Wyoming or Flaming Gorge Reservoir during the winter.  Sometimes early season snow storms will push the elk out of the high country earlier than normal.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nIn warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings.  Later in the season when thereâ€™s usually more water available, hunters do best either glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot or stalking elk through the trees.  Visibility on this unit is low due to dense trees.  Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Elk rut:</u><br>\nThe elk rut usually runs from mid-September to early October.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find elk:</u><br>\nElk are found throughout much of the unit.  There are water sources across the unit in the form of stock ponds, creeks, and springs.  In warm and dry weather, elk can be found close to these water sources.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the North Slope, West Daggett:</u><br>\nGood areas to look for elk include Hwy 44, Deep Creek, Greendale Junction, and along the road to Spirit Lake.\n",
