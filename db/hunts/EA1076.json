It is not legal to drive a motorized vehicle anywhere you may kill an animal. It is now unlawful to hunt elk in the area just south of Lyman along SR-24. Please consult the written description.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Depending on where and when you hunt you could find large amounts of snow, limited access, or roadless areas.Be prepared for some rough roads and rocky trails. Always carry plenty of water and tell someone where you are hunting. There are some remote areas on this unit. It is very easy to become disoriented especially when hiking.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for variable conditions. Check weather forecasts often.  Snow storms often occur during this hunt.  Usually snow this time of year is here to stay. Snowdrifts are common on roads.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions. ATVs or snowmobiles may be needed for access. The later in the year the higher chances you will have of the snow impacting access to many areas of this hunt. ",

If there is no snow then no sweat, you have great access and elk can generally be found in wintering areas. These include areas near Johns Valley, Mud Springs bench and the Parker Mountain. The areas around Smooth Knoll and Dark Valley often have wintering groups of antlerless elk. Access to some of these areas is difficult with the best conditions. Road hunting the unit is sometimes attempted but success is very low using this method. ",
