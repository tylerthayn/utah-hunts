			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": " Access can be challenging and travel maps are recommended for motorized vehicle access. Storms can make roads in the clay impassable. This is a very remote hunting area with variable numbers of elk highly impacted by weather patterns. It is not legal to drive a motorized vehicle anywhere you may kill an animal. ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Depending on where and when you hunt you could find large amounts of snow, limited access, and roadless areas.Be prepared for some rough roads and rocky trails. Always carry plenty of water and tell someone where you are hunting. There are some remote areas on this unit. It is very easy to become disoriented especially when hiking. There is no cell service anywhere in this hunting area.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for variable conditions. Check weather forecasts often.  Snow storms often occur during this hunt.  Usually snow this time of year is here to stay. Snowdrifts are common on roads.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions. Storms can make roads in the clay impassable.  ATVs or snowmobiles may be needed for access. The later in the year the higher chances you will have of the snow impacting access to many areas of this hunt. ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This can be a challenging antlerless tag due to access during the hunt. If there is no snow then no sweat, you have great access and elk can generally be found in wintering areas. These areas are commonly the reseeded areas in the west and northeast portions of the hunt area. Access to some of these areas is difficult with the best conditions. Elk numbers here vary depending on hunting pressure and storms. Elk generally access the Circle Cliffs from Indian Trail Bench using Stair Canyon. Sometimes looking around the saddle leading into The Gulch is a good strategy. Water is limited and elk will use water sources if there is no frost or snow available.",
