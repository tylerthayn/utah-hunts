			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This can be a very fun hunt for everybody, especially if we get some snow during the hunt.  Cow elk are very social and tend to be bunched up in groups throughout the year.  When you do find a herd of cows, pay special attention to which elk you are shooting at and stick with that one.  Do not start flock shooting if she doesn't go down immediately.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Flash floods and lightning strikes are very likely during inclement weather, make sure to watch the sky and plan accordingly.  Always let somebody know where you'll be, and when you expect to be back.  Cell phone service is somewhat limited throughout the unit.  Black bears are regularly seen on the San Juan unit.  Keep a clean camp and make sure to place all food and garbage in locations that bears cannot get into.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges and flash floods in the canyon bottoms.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The elk on the San Juan limited entry unit typically migrate from West to East and also South. Many of the bulls will start this migration after the rut ends in early October. The majority of the public land elk will winter on or near Dry Mesa, Salt Creek Mesa and Bridger Jack Mesa.  Elk also migrate off of the high mesa tops, into lower elevation valleys throughout the unit and can also be found in rugged canyons like Montezuma Canyon.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Start scouting prior to your hunt in September. The elk probably won’t be in the exact same area during the hunt, but it will give you a chance to see how many elk you can expect on your hunt. The unit is very large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads, access points and watering holes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is primarily when elk are out feeding in open meadows.  This is also when most rutting activity takes place. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Elk rut:</u> There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas for the San Juan limited entry subunit:\n</u>\n<br>\n<i>Abajo Mountain</i>- Higher elevations include large alpine meadows with aspen/conifer stands surrounding, lower elevations contain oak stands with large sagebrush clearings, good camping, nice roads, holds a good number of elk.\n<br>\n<i>North Elk Ridge</i>- A good area for elk, timbered North slopes, aspen stands,  limited clearings for glassing, camping, nice roads, several different draws, canyons and mesa tops to hunt.\n<br>\n<i>South Elk Ridge</i>- Good roads on mesa tops, limited access to rugged canyons, great area for pack-in hunts (Dark Canyon).",
