Let others know where you will be hunting, camped, etc. Some have been stranded by flat tires, very muddy conditions, flash floods, etc.  Carry chains, survival kit, etc. Many areas have fair cell phone coverage but not all.

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Pre-season, the Cedar Mtn elk <u>sometimes</u> use the desert shrub hills between Cedar Mountain and the farmlands east of the town of Lawrence. Other times they will use the Pinion-Juniper slopes of Cedar Mountian and are difficult to locate. If you see tracks you might be able to track them. A small number of Fishlake elk will sometimes cross I-70 during the winter and go onto the benches west of the Coal Cliffs. Sometimes elk from the Manti also winter in the Coal Cliffs area, but generally these are low in number as well. Unless you know this herd or have a lot of time this is not an ideal hunt for young hunters expecting to see and harvest an elk.",
