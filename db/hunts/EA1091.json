			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit consists of approximately 35% private property and public hunters should not expect access.  Most years cow elk will be starting to move down in elevation during this hunt.  Roads on this unit become very muddy and oftentimes impassable if there is any precipitation.  Four wheel drive is strongly advised. The private property is posted and a GPS showing private/public property boundaries is recommended.  Even though the unit has private property, there is still 65% public land that is huntable.  Don't expect to gain access to hunt the private property.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt can be very extreme.  Be prepared for snow and cold temperatures.  There is usually snow on the ground by the end of November.  Inversions are also a typical occurrence on this unit during the winter.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nElk in this unit move up and down in elevation throughout the year.  During normal winters, elk will move down off the rim to the north and south.  In dry years, elk will stay on the top of Diamond through the winter. <br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nDuring this season when thereâ€™s usually more water available, hunters do best glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot.  Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, elk are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  Elk can move long distances in short periods of time, especially if they are disturbed by vehicles or people.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Elk rut:</u><br>\nThe elk rut usually runs from mid-September to early October and does not affect this hunt.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find elk:</u><br>\nElk can be found throughout the unit during the hunting season; however the majority of the cows will be in lower elevations.  Roads also become impassable due to mud and snow drifts.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the South Slope, Diamond Mtn Unit:</u><br>\nGood areas to look for cow elk include Diamond Rim to the South, Wild Mountain, Top of Crouse Canyon, Marshall Draw, Warren Draw, and Mail Draw, depending on road conditions.  \n",
