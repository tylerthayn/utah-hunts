			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt and has a considerable amount of hunting pressure.  There are no CWMUs on this unit.  The Uintah Mountain range can provide a remote hunt with many hunters but there are fewer elk compared to limited entry areas.  Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed for elk.  It is generally Lodge Pole Pine without much of an understory.  On the west side of Mosby Mountain there is a large burn that provides a lot of winter range habitat.  Road access is allowed on the majority of the unit.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Be prepared for adverse weather conditions with limited cell coverage.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, and wind.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two.  Be prepared for dry or muddy/snowy conditions.  \n",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nElk on this unit migrate down in elevation during the winter and tend to stay on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  During this hunt it is not uncommon to find bulls right at timberline.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Elk Rut:</u>\nThe elk rut usually occurs from mid-September to mid-October.  Listen for bugles, and use cow calls to attract other elk.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>There are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. </u>\n<br>\n\nThere is a variety of habitat to hunt during the any weapon hunt.  There is pinyon/juniper, sage brush savanna, thick lodge pole pine, and areas above timber line.  The larger openings on the forest are called parks and can be found on most maps but the smaller openings are scattered across the high country.  If you choose to hunt the high country, be prepared for unpredictable weather and rocky terrain.\n<br>\n\nDuring the hunts most of the elk on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes with conifer.  I would recommend trying to locate remote watering holes or wallows, and hunt feeding areas.\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit:\n<br>\n\n<i>Whiterocks Canyon</i>â€“ Whiterocks River is the western unit boundary, steep terrain.\n<br>\n<i>Paradise Park</i>- Higher forest terrain, steep forested canyons.\n<br>\n<i>Mosby Mountain</i>- High aspen forest, with large sagebrush bowls, excellent habitat.  \n<br>\n<i>Red Cloud Loop Rd</i>-Long road that starts in Dry Fork Canyon (west of Vernal).  It takes you all the way through the Vernal unit, and comes out on Hwy 191.\n",
