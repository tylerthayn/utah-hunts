			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is currently over objective by over 2,000 elk.  This hunt is intended to help reduce this elk herd. This unit is usually a hard unit to hunt due to the lack of hunting pressure on the adjacent Ute tribal lands.  In the past the Ute Tribe had cow elk tags for late season elk hunts, however, the tribe has not had any late season cow elk hunts on their lands for a number of years which means the elk that move onto the tribal lands can stay there with no hunting pressure all winter.  The majority of the elk on this unit move onto Tribal Lands and will probably stay there unless the weather allows them to drift back up onto the Forest Service lands.  Permit numbers were reduced this year to reduce hunting pressure and allow more elk to move back onto the public lands. \n Hunters should be aware of the Ute tribal lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on tribal lands but hunting near the tribal boundary will be the best areas to hunt.  There are no CWMUs on this unit.  \nThe unit includes the High Uintas Wilderness area but the elk will not be anywhere near that high in elevation during this hunt.\nRoad access on the unit is limited to mostly canyon bottoms due to the steepness of the terrain.",

			"CURRENT_POP": "Around 7500 elk  in Jan. 2015.  This herd is over objective by around 2,500 elk and has been increasing. The Division is obligated by law to manage this herd towards objective so large numbers of antlerless elk permits are currently being issued.  Increased antlerless harvest is needed. ",
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Elk on this unit move down in elevation for the winter and they winter primarily on Ute tribal lands and on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  The elk move towards the tribal land boundary as soon as they get much hunting pressure starting in Oct.  There is very little hunting pressure on the tribal lands so elk have learned to go there as soon as hunting pressure starts. By the time this huint starts there are very few elk, if any in the Wilderness Area.<br>\n\nRecommended areas in the South Slope, Yellowstone:\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. Locating elk on public lands will be the difficult part this year.\n\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit:\n\nNorth Fork of the Duchesne- limited road access, but elk can usually be found scattered out to the east of the canyon\nBlind Stream - limited road access, tribal land down low\nRock Creek - paved road access, steep areas\nPigeon Water - popular area but hunters must be aware of tribal boundary\nLake Fork/Moon Lake- paved road access, some private property along the paved road\nYellowstone - need to be aware of tribal boundary\n77 Flat/Burnt Mill- a little flatter area, be aware of tribal boundary, hunt along the tribal boundary\nDry Gulch- usually has elk this time of year near the tribal boundary \nUinta Canyon- tribal lands down low, Lower Pole Creek area has been good in recent years\nFarm Creek-  will likely need to get away from roads to find the elk, has been a good area the last couple years\nWhiterocks Canyon - Whiterocks River is the eastern unit boundary, steep terrain, usually some elk in the rough canyons north of Farm Creek trail head area  \n   \nPrivate Lands areas that usually have elk during this hunt:  Arcadia, north side of Tabiona, Talmage, Mtn. Home, Altonah, Bluebell, Neola all have elk that come down off of the tribal land and onto private property when there is enough snow.  If it snows early there may be land owners willing to let the public hunt elk if they move onto their private lands.\n",
