			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Just southeast of Mount Pleasant, Utah is the Bear Mountain Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) ranging from 10000 feet to about 6200 feet. The west part of the Unit is a series of moderate sloping benches and rapidly climbing slopes. On the east at the higher elevations, Bear Mountain CWMU, is cut by the Straight Fork of Pleasant Creek, Dry Pole Creek, and the North and South Forks of Coral Fork.  The most common elevation is 7300 feet but ranges from 6200 feet to 10000 feet with an elevation difference of 3800 feet.  Fifty (50%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7300 feet and 9100 feet an elevation difference of 1800 feet.<br><br>Much of the Bear Mountain Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit is covered with Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41). At the higher elevations there are substantial areas of Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22). At lower elevations there is some Colorado Plateau Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (36). At the higher elevation besides the Aspen Forest and Woodland, there is a mixture of Rocky Mountain Subalpine Mesic Spruce-Fir Forest and Woodland (28), Rocky Mountain Montane Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland (32), and Inter-Mountain West Aspen-Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland Complex (38). There are patches of Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62) scattered from the lowest elevation to the highest.<br><br>One of the Bear Mountain Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, ELECTRIC LAKE (422424), is about 13.0 km northeast from the northeast edge of the CWMU.  ELECTRIC LAKE  has twenty-seven (27) years of records, 1980 - 2007.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 6.31 inches, but it can be as high as 10.05 inches or as low as 1.73 inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 26 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 18 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 4 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  There is no reliable snowfall data for ELECTRIC LAKE.  FALL temperature at ELECTRIC LAKE  averages 36.6 degrees F. but can be as high as 81.0 degrees F. or as low as -22.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 71 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and no days above 90 degrees F.",
