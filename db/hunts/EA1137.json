			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Grazing Pature Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is located north of Fishlake, and the northwest corner is a short\ndistance from Rex Reservoir. The high point of the Unit is 9200 feet which is in the south and along the east border. The Unit is cut in half by Lost Creek that ranges from 7200 feet to 8700\nfeet elevation. The westside of the Unit is around 7900 feet. There are some very steep areas towards the middle of the Unit as it descends from 9200 feet to Lost Creek.  The most common elevation is 7600 feet but ranges from 7300 feet to 9300 feet with an elevation difference of 2000 feet.  Fifty-one percent (51%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7800 feet and 8700 feet an elevation difference of 900 feet.\n<br><br> The Grazing Pasture Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is dominated by three (3) land cover types. On the eastside is an area dominated by Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22). On the westside the area is dominated by Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41). Scattered throughout these two (2) land cover types are patches of Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62).\n<br><br>One of the Grazing Pasture Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, KOOSHAREM (424764), is about 27.4 km southwest from the southwest edge of the CWMU.  KOOSHAREM has one hundred fourteen (114) years of records, 1893 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 2.44 inches, but it can be as high as 5.28 inches or as low as 0.58 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 15 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 8 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 1 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 4.7 inches but can be as high as 23.3 inches.  FALL temperature at KOOSHAREM averages 45.0 degrees F. but can be as high as 92.0 degrees F. or as low as -17.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 60 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and no days above 90 degrees F.",
