			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Moon's Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is located west of Hanna,Utah. The highest elevation on the east side starts about 8400 feet and increases to 8800 feet before dropping down into several drainages, but it rises again to 8200 feet on the west side of the Unit. In the north, the West Fork of the Duchesne River, ranging from 7200 feet to 7600 feet, cuts the Unit. In the south, Sand Creek, ranging from 6800 feet to 8000 feet, cuts the Unit. On the west side, Little Sand Creek, ranging from 7500 feet to 8000 feet, cuts the unit.  The most common elevation is 8000 feet but ranges from 6700feet to 8800 feet with an elevation difference of 2100 feet.  Fifty-seven percent (57%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7500 feet and 8100 feet an elevation difference of 600 feet.<br><br>Over half of the land cover on the Moon's Ranch CWMU is Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62). This cover type is generally distributed over the entire unit. Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41) and Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22) are the next largest contributors. Several hundred hectares each of Colorado Plateau Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (36) and Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland round out most of the land cover types.\n<br><br>One of the Moons Ranch Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, HANNA (423624), is 0.5 km east of the east edge of the CWMU.  HANNA has forty-two (42) years of records, 1952 - 1994.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 3.35 inches, but it can be as high as 4.43 inches or as low as 2.52 inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 10 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inches of precipitation, 8 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inches, or 2 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inches of prercipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 2.2 inches but can be as high as 5.0 inches.  FALL temperature at HANNA averages 63.4 degrees F. but can be as high as 78.0 degrees F. or as low as 5.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 23 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and no day above 90 degrees F.",
