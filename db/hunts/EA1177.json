			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Woodruff Creek South Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is located southwest of Woddruff, Utah. High elevations in the east are 7900 feet and 8400 feet in the west. Woodruff Creek (6800 feet to 7300 feet) forms the north border along with Woodruff Reservoir (6800 feet) and approximates the west Unit border. Meachem Canyon (7000 feet to 7700 feet) forms the south border. One primary drainage, Road Hollow, flowing east to west cuts the Unit, ranging from 7200 feet to 7800 feet.  The most common elevation is 7800 feet but ranges from 6900 feet to 8500 feet with an elevation difference of 1600 feet.  Fifty-four percent (54%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7400 feet and 8000 feet an elevation difference of 600 feet.<br><br>Almost seventy-five percent (75%) of the Woodruff Creek South Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62). The only other major land cover types is Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22). This Aspen Forest and Woodland are in large patches in the middle and towards the west of the Unit. On the westside Rocky Mountain Subalpine Mesic Spruce-Fir Forest and Woodland occur in several large patches.\n<br><br>One of the Woodruff Creek South Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, WOODRUFF (429595), is about 14.6 km northeast from the northeast edge of the CWMU.  WOODRUFF has one hundred eleven (111) years of records, 1897 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 2.64 inches, but it can be as high as 5.18 inches or as low as 0.64 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 15 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 8 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 1 day of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 8.7 inches but can be as high as 29.2 inches.  FALL temperature at WOODRUFF averages 40.8 degrees F. but can be as high as 111.0 degrees F. or as low as -26.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 73 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 6 days above 90 degrees F.",
