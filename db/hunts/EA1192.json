			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Pahvant Ensign Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is divided into two parts, the west part and the east part. The west part is located southwest of Kanosh, Utah, and the east part is more directly south of Kanosh. On the north and west part of the west Unit the boundaries are hard surface roads. The highest elevations on the west part are in the extreme south, 6600 feet. This elevation drops into Dog Valley around 5700 feet. Then the elevation rises again to 6400 feet before dropping down into White Sage Flat, 5000 feet. Another rise in elevation to Six Mile Point (5400 feet) and higher to 5900 feet before dropping down to about 5000 feet just outside of the town of Kanosh. The east\npart of the Unit is much smaller. The east part is northwest and northeast of Gardner Hollow Reservoir (8300 feet). On the east part the highest elevations are at 9000 feet on the east unit border. These elevation decrease to 8800 feet at Pole Hill and are about 7900 feet on the westside of this part. Skinner Hollow, 8100 feet to 8600 feet; Lewis Hollow. 8500 to 8600 feet; Pole Creek, 7900 feet to 9100 feet; and Skunk Creek, 7300 feet to 7600 feet are major drainages that cut the east part.  The most common elevation is 5700 feet but ranges from 5000 feet to 9100 feet with an elevation difference of 4100 feet.  Forty-nine percent (49%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 5400 feet and 8300 feet an elevation difference of 2900 feet.<br><br>The Pahvant Ensign Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) has three parts, but the southeast parts are small in comparison and close together. The larger part of the CWMU is dominated by Colorado Plateau Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (36), and though the smaller parts have Pinyon-Juniper, the dominate land cover on these subunits is Inter-Mountain Basins\nMontane Sagebrush Steppe (62). There are localized areas of Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland (48) on the large area, and localized areas of Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41) on the smaller areas.  <br><br>One of the nearest weather stations, KANOSH (424527), is about 2.4 km northeast from the northeast edge of the CWMU.  KANOSH has one hundred (100) years of records, 1907 - 2007.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 3.52 inches, but it can be as high as 8.43 inches or as low as 0.69 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 14 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 9 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 2 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 12.0 inches but can be as high as 66.0 inches.  FALL temperature at KANOSH averages 53.6 degrees F. but can be as high as 99.0 degrees F. or as low as 1.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 27 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 4 days above 90 degrees F.",
