			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The elk on the Avintaquin unit will typically migrate from West to East. This migration will start in early October and will continue throughout the winter depending on the amount of snow. Many of the elk that will winter on the Avintaquin unit will spend their summers in the Strawberry Valley.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips</u>:  Start scouting in late June early July many large herds of cows and calves will be up high and in the open. They may not be in the exact same area during the hunt, but they will be in the same general areas for the October hunt. The unit is very large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. \n<br>\n\nMost spike bulls are with cow and calf herds during the hunts. Keep this in mind as you plan your hunt. There is a lot of pressure put on these elk during the general season hunts, this will push the elk towards private land or areas with difficult access or terrain. After opening morning spend your time hunting the thick timber canyons or large aspen stands. Road hunting is not a very effective method of hunting during the general season.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Elk rut:</u> There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n    \n<u>Recommended areas Avintaquin Subunit:</u>\n<br>\n<i>Reservation Ridg</i>e- big area, road on the divide, great area for glassing, not as many elk as Currant Creek\n<br>\n<i>Strawberry Peak Area</i>- Highest peak on Avintaquin, great access to roadless areas(Slab Canyon and Cow Hollow), great area for glassing on the October hunt. This area is difficult to access in November.\n<br>\n<i>Long Ridge</i>- low density for elk, but can hold some elk, great glassing area, good access to roadless area (Lion Hollow), best on the November hunt, a couple of nice burn areas, steep and rough terrain\n<br>\n<i>Lake Canyon, Right Fork of Indian Canyon, Skitzy WMA</i>- not good areas for the early hunts, but can be good areas for the November hunt if there are early snow storms.",
