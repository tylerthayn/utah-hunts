			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access. Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit. Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers. Satellite phones do work in the area. The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nThe Book Cliffs mountain range is one of the more remote areas in Utah. There are no service stations for many miles. Plan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, and good tires with extra spares.\n\nThe Book Cliffs has a high bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears. If you do have problems with bears please report them to the DWR Northeastern Regional Office as soon as possible (435 781-9453), or call the local dispatch center (435 789-4222).",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Book Cliffs elk herd has been stagnant for several years, biologists and researchers have been monitoring the populations age structure and pregnancy rates and we have observed alarming results - a very old elk population with extremely low pregnancy rates. This cow hunt was designed to remove some elk, hopefully some of these older cows that are abundant in the population. Older females have been documented to produce fewer calves. We are working to have a healthy and productive elk population on the Book Cliffs. To get better data on the age class of this population all successful applicants will be contacted by the DWR and given instructions to collect and submit teeth for aging harvested animals. It is very important that hunters submit teeth from harvested cows.<br>\n<br><br>\n<br>\nThis is a quality elk hunt that should provide plenty of opportunities to harvest a cow elk, if you are an experienced hunter or even a novice/youth hunter. Many times I see elk during these season dates near main roads and fairly accessible areas. The cows and calves will migrate to lower elevations but most will stay along the Divide Ridge. Once the snow melts elk will be more tied to sustainable water sources. During the summer month’s elk congregate to the Divide Ridge. After the calving season you can find large herds of elk. Once the rut begins the bulls begin to herd up smaller herds of cows and the elk seem to spread out through the whole Book Cliffs Range. Some years the temperature starts to fall and causes the ponds and guzzlers to freeze. Springs and creeks will still flow, and can be good areas to hunt. <br>\n<br>\nSome of the main roads/areas to focus your hunting efforts on are: Seep Ridge Road, McCook Ridge, Big Park, Bitter Creek, and the many spur ridges and valleys adjacent to the Book Cliffs Divide Road. Take careful note of the boundary with the Book Cliffs, Little Creek or Roadless area if you proceed west beyond 10 Mile Knoll on the Divide Road, this area is not included in this hunt boundary.<br>\n<br>\nScouting Tips: A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area. There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of grass that is excellent for elk. Elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.\n",
