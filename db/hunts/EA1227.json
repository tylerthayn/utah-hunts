			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt boundary is small and designed to target a large herd of migratory elk that comes down in the winter onto private land. Presence of elk is sporadic and typically associated with a snowstorm or other weather even that brings them down off the mountain into the valley. There is very little public land within this hunt boundary and the elk are usually found on private land between Meadow and Kanosh. Hunters should not apply for this hunt unless they have already gained access to hunt these private lands.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "At times there can be 200-300 elk laying in the grass between Meadow and Kanosh, but these movements into the valley are sporadic and difficult to anticipate. The most consistent factor I've seen pushing the elk down is weather. The hunt is designed to pressure them when they come down into the valley so they learn this is not a good place for them to spend the winter. In the past we've had elk hit on the road between Meadow and Kanosh and even had some try to cross I-15 in the dark. There are also numerous haystacks in the area that they heavily damage if they're allowed to get comfortable. There is also a smaller group of elk near Halfway Hill that sometimes comes down close to I-15 during the winter. ",
