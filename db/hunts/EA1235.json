			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Sharp Mountain Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is about 5 km southeast from Porcupine Reservoir in south Cache County.  Almost all of the CWMU is in Cache County, but a small section in the southeast is in Weber County.  The CWMU's name sake, Sharp Mountain rises to 9100 feet.  Porcupine Ridge in the north is 8500 feet and in the south higher elevations are around 8300 feet.  Davenport Creek in the south ranges from 6000 feet to 7400 feet on the unit.  In the north Porcupine Creek ranges from 7400 feet to 8800 feet on the unit, and in the, east La Plata Canyon ranges from 7000 feet to 7900 feet.<br><br> Much of the Sharp Mountain Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit is covered (32%) with Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62).  This Sagebrush Steppe is not concentrated in just one area but is spread throughout the CWMU.  Similarly, Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22) covers 29% of the CWMU and is spread throughout the unit too.  Inter-Mountain West Aspen-Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland Complex (38) covers 7% of the unit, and Inter-Mountain Basins Mountain Mahogany Woodland and Shrubland (44) covers 5% of the unit.  The Woodland Complex is spread throughout the unit, but the Mahogany Woodland and Shrubland is more concentrated in the southwest part of the unit.<br><br>One of the Green Canyon Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, LOGAN FARM (425194), is about 8.8 km northwest from the northwest edge of the CWMU.  LOGAN FARM has thirty-nine (39) years of records, 1989 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 4.28 inches, but it can be as high as 7.98 inches or as low as 0.96 inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 21 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 12 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 2 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  There will also be 1 day of greater than or equal to 1.00 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 5.3 inches but can be as high as 15.5 inches.  FALL temperature at LOGAN FARM averages 47.0 degrees F. but can be as high as 94.0 degrees F. or as low as -16.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 47 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 1 day above 90 degrees F.",
