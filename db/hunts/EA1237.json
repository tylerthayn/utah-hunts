			"SAFETY_CONS": "Flash floods and lightning strikes are very likely during inclement weather, make sure to watch the sky and plan accordingly. Always let somebody know where you'll be, and when you expect to be back. Cell phone service is somewhat limited throughout the unit. Black bears are regularly seen on the La Sal unit. Keep a clean camp and make sure to place all food and garbage in locations that bears cannot get into.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat. Late summer and early fall monsoon storms occur regularly in this area. Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions, as well as flash flooding in canyon bottoms.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Migration Patterns: The elk on the La Sal Mountains typically migrate from West to East. Many bulls will start this migration after the rut ends in early October. The majority of the elk will winter near the Utah/Colorado border. Elk also migrate off of the high mesa tops, into lower elevation valleys throughout the unit.\n\nScouting Tips: Start scouting in late July many of the elk will be up high and in the open and in large groups. They probably won’t be in the exact same area during the hunt, but it will give you a chance to see how many elk you can expect on your hunt. The unit is large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points.\n\nBehavior: As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk.\n\nElk rut: There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.  Use vocal males to help find cow groups.\n\nRecommended areas La Sal Mountains, North Subunit:\nBar-A Creek- Northeast side of the mountain, large meadows with aspen stands mixed with conifers, great camping, nice roads, holds a good number of elk.\nPine Ridge- This entire area is good for elk, timbered North slopes, aspen stands, great access, camping, nice roads, several different draws or canyons to hunt.\nDeep Creek- No roads and limited access, great area for pack-in hunts, borders private lands in many spots, great area for elk.\nTaylor Flat- Large sagebrush clearing surrounded by rolling hills of pine and aspen stands.<br>\nNorth Beaver & Polar Mesa- Good access, thick pinyon and juniper stands with some high vantage points for glassing.",
