			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This hunt has a small boundary and can have high numbers of elk or no elk, depending on the day. This hunt was designed to reduce browsing pressure in emerging aspen shoots in recently logged/treated aspens stands. Elk will often hide in heavy timber areas during the day and then enter the hunt boundary during evening, night time, and morning hours to feed. A good spot to watch for elk is near Box Creek (the part that is within the boundary). This hunt may take several trips to the area to find the elk within the boundary. First and last light will be the most productive times of the day.<br>\nBest success may be experienced by hunting the opening day, as the elk will likely be less wary and be found within the boundary.",
