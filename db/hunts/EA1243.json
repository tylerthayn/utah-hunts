			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt and has a considerable amount of hunting pressure.  This hunt has many hunters and there are fewer elk compared to limited entry areas.  This hunt was established to help during severe winters when elk come lower in the Valley and cause damage to hay stacks.  Most of the elk on Taylor Mtn. when pressured flee to the large mine where there is no hunting.  There are some areas that the elk will stay in that border the mine.  Little Mtn. has a small resident elk herd, and hunters have had success hunting the top of it in the past.  Road access is allowed on the majority of the unit.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Be prepared for adverse weather conditions and limited cell coverage.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two.  Be prepared for dry or muddy/snowy conditions.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "There is a federally managed refuge called The Ouray National Wildlife Refuge.  It is located south of Vernal and has the potential of holding elk during the winter months.  The refuge has their own set of regulations and hunting areas.  Contact them to answer any hunting questions <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/refuge/ouray\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fws.gov/refuge/ouray</a>.  There is a significant amount of private land in this hunt boundary.  It can be difficult to obtain permission to hunt on these private lands.  Please consider this before you apply for this hunt.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nElk on this unit migrate down in elevation during the winter and tend to stay on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  In harsh conditions the elk will pull off of these faces and come lower onto this hunt unit.  \n",
