			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt occurs during the General Season Any Bull elk hunt.  This hunt is intended to help reduce this elk herd. This unit is currently over objective by over 2,000 elk because a large number of the elk on this unit move onto the adjacent Ute tribal lands where there is little to no hunting pressure and no public access. The elk that move onto the tribal lands often stay there with no hunting pressure all fall and winter. At least half of the elk on the unit have learned to move onto the tribal lands as soon as hunting pressure starts in Sept. and the rest will trickle down throughout the fall. During this hunt, the majority of the elk on the unit are moving onto Tribal Lands and may stay there unless the weather cooperates and they drift back up onto the Forest Service lands.  Hunters should be aware of the Ute tribal lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on tribal lands but hunting near the tribal boundary are usually the best areas to hunt.  There are no CWMUs on this unit.  \nThe unit includes the High Uintas Wilderness area, but many of the elk will be moving down out of the wilderness prior to or during this hunt.\nRoad access on the unit is limited to mostly canyon bottoms due to the steepness of the terrain.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Elk on this unit move down in elevation for the winter and they winter primarily on Ute tribal Lands and on south facing slopes at lower elevation on the Forest Service lands.  The elk move towards the tribal land boundary as soon as they get much hunting pressure starting in Sept. There is very little hunting pressure on the tribal lands so elk have learned to go there as soon as hunting pressure starts.  They will also move into difficult to access areas on the Forest. Locating elk on public land is the real key for this hunt. Remember that you are also able to hunt elk on private land on this unit if you can gain written permission.\n\nRecommended areas in the South Slope, Yellowstone:\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit.\n\n\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit and working east):\n<br>\n<br>\nSoapstone Basin and Lightening Ridge- Good road access, but usually fairly popular and the roads are heavily traveled all summer so the elk move away from the areas with roads<br>\n\nNorth Fork of the Duchesne- paved road access in the lower main canyon, tribal lands down low\n\nBlind Stream- limited road access, tribal land down low\n\nRock Creek- paved road access, steep areas\n\nPigeon Water- popular area but hunters must be aware of the tribal boundary\n\nLake Fork/Moon Lake- paved road access, some private property along the paved road\n\nYellowstone- need to be aware of tribal boundary\n\n77 Flat/Burnt Mill- a little flatter area, be aware of tribal boundary, hunt along the tribal boundary\n\nDry Gulch- usually has elk this time of year near the tribal boundary \n\nUinta Canyon- tribal lands down low, Lower Pole Creek area has been good in recent years\n\nFarm Creek-  will likely need to get away from roads to find the elk, has been a good area the last couple years\n\nWhiterocks Canyon- Whiterocks River is the eastern unit boundary, steep terrain, usually some elk in the rough canyons north of Farm Creek trail head area  \n   \n\nPrivate Lands areas that usually have elk during this hunt:</i>  Arcadia, north side of Tabiona, Talmage, Mtn. Home, Altonah, Bluebell, Neola all have elk that come down off of the tribal land and onto private property when there is enough snow.  If it snows early there may be land owners willing to let the public hunt elk if they move onto their private lands.  \n ",
