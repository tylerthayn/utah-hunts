Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"InReach\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",

Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Usually warm temperatures and monsoonal moisture dominate the weather pattern. Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  ",

Elk typically will come to the fields in the evening and return to the foothills during the day.  They are usually visible in the open areas on Public Land in that short window of time.
