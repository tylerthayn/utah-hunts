To provide this opportunity, the Division issues antlerless elk-control permits. You may only obtain an antlerless elk-control permit if you have a buck, bull or once-in-a-lifetime permit for areas that overlap antlerless elk-control hunting units.<br>\n<br>\nIf you obtained a permit (including general season) to harvest a buck, bull or once-in-a-lifetime species on any of the above units (<B>CWMU permits are no longer included</b>), you have the option of purchasing an antlerless elk-control permit.<br>\n<br>\nThe antlerless elk-control permit allows you to harvest an antlerless elk in the same unit where you’ll already be hunting an antlered big game animal. <b>Antlerless elk-control permits are not valid statewide.</b> Please verify all hunt boundaries before heading into the field. You may hunt the antlerless elk only during the season dates—and with the same weapon—listed on your buck, bull or once-in-a-lifetime permit.<br><br>\n<i>Example 1:</i> If you have a permit to hunt buck deer on the Pine Valley unit, you may purchase an antlerless elk-control permit and harvest an antlerless elk on the Pine Valley unit during your deer hunt.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Example 2:</i> If you have an any bull elk permit and you’re hunting on the Morgan, South Rich unit, you can obtain an antlerless elk-control permit. You can harvest a bull elk anywhere on the unit, but you may only harvest an antlerless elk within the Morgan, South Rich elk-control unit.<br><BR>\n<B>NOTE:</b>If you harvest with your buck, bull or OILT permit before harvesting with your antlerless control permit, your antlerless control permit remains valid for the remainder of the season listed on your qualifying buck, bull or OILT permit.",
