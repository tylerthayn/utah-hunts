			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "<b>Private Lands Only. </b><br>\n<b>This Hunt is entirely on Private Property. Written permission is required to hunt on Private Property. Obtain permission before purchasing this permit.</b> <br>\nDue to legal privacy issues the DWR does not provide a list of landowners that allow access to hunters.  Hunters need to identify and have written permission from landowners before they purchase this permit.<br><br>\n  \nElk are very smart animals. They respond quickly to hunting pressure. They learn quickly where they are pursued and where they are not. There is a significant portion of the elk in the state that have learned to \"hide out\" on private property and tribal lands during the fall hunting seasons where they are inaccessible to the public.  The purpose of the Private Lands Only antlerless elk hunt is to provide hunting pressure to elk on private property to encourage them to move onto public lands where they are more beneficial to the hunting public and to reduce depredation on private property.<br>\nThere are numerous areas where elk have become year round residents of low elevation agricultural areas on this unit. This unit is over the management objective by over 2000 elk. This elk herd is very productive and produces a large number of calves each year.  Additional antlerless elk harvest is needed just to maintain this elk herd at it current size.<br>  \nThis will be a difficult hunt for those that are unfamiliar with the area and individual property owners. The intent is for sportsmen that are able to get permission to hunt these private lands to put pressure on those elk that have become habituated to private property.  The reason for the large number of permits for this hunt is to ensure that those sportsmen who can acquire access can then purchase a permit over the counter and hunt these elk as hard as possible while they are on private property.  The intent is to not sell out of permits in case a need arises in late winter where additional hunting pressure on private lands becomes necessary to address depredation situations. <br>",

At times during this hunt elk can be found on private property almost anywhere along the tribal boundary which runs along the north boundary of the hunt area from Hanna to the Whiterocks river.  Elk are also consistently found in the following areas during this hunt: Arcadia, Bridgeland, Myton, Upalco, Cedar View, Randeltt, Montez Creek, Lower Uinta River drainage, etc... <br>\nHunters may be able to identify individual landowners to ask for permission by using the Duchesne and Uintah County Parcel Viewer websites that are available through the Counties online.<br>\n<br>\nHunters should be respectful of private landowners and their property & livestock.",
