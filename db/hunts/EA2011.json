			"PRIV_TRIBE_LAND_ISSUES": "There are no tribal lands to contend with.  The vast majority of the early bull elk hunt habitat is on public land.  A few exceptions include the following areas.  The northeast portion of the mountain near Scofield Reservoir has a high percentage of private land on good elk habitat.  Most of these lands are managed under the CWMU program and can not provide hunter access as your permit will not be valid on those properties.  Other private properties require prior written permission before hunting.  Small pockets of private lands at high elevations can be found surrounding Electric Lake and on East Mountain.  Late Season any weapon hunters may encounter private lands in the Spring Canyon area west of Helper as well as upper Gordon Creek.\n \nWeather Conditions: The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until the first week of October.<br>\n<br>\n",
