It is advised to obtain permission before obtaining a permit.\n<BR>\n<BR>\nThis is a very large hunt area. Elk are in small groups throughout the area and move around on a regular basis. The habitat is generally mountains with large open valleys between, with grasslands in the bottoms, sagebrush on the benches that transition into juniper woodlands. Access is good. The terrain varies greatly, from flat valley bottoms to steep mountain canyons. Elk are primarily found in juniper woodlands and adjacent grassy areas.",

			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunderstorms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.  Snow and cold temperatures can be a factor during the later parts of the season.",
