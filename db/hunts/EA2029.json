Be careful crossing the Price River especially if it has rained recently.  This road is found along SR-6 about 35 miles south of Price.  An additional access is the Horse Canyon Road on SR-6 about 25 miles south of Price.  This will provide access to the cliffs above Horse Canyon and Lila Canyon.  Some hunters will drive the Hastings Road on the east side of the Green River in the town of Green River.  From this road you can glass across the river to the cliffs on the west side of the river.  You will obviously need some sort of boat to cross the river.<br><br>\n\n<u>Pronghorn:</u>Major access points include the following roads (all are accessed via SR-6); the Coal Creek Road in Wellington, the Soldier Creek Road in Wellington, the Clark Valley Road, SR-123 near Sunnyside, the Horse Canyon Road, and the Lila Canyon Road.<br><br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer:</u>  Major access points include the Nine Mile Canyon road found at the east end of Wellington and the Bruin Point Road which is accessed via SR-123 going through the town of Sunnyside.  These two roads will access much of the public lands on the West Tavaputs Plateau.<br>\n<br>\nElk:  The major access points for elk hunting will be the Bruin Point road which is accessed via SR-123 through the town of Sunnyside, the Argyle Canyon road near the top of the summit of US-191 between Price and Duchesne, and the Nine Mile Canyon road out of the town of Wellington.<br>\n<br>\nBison:  The Horse Canyon Road is found 25 miles south of Price on SR-6.  This accesses the Range Creek area via Horse Canyon or Turtle Canyon.

Some private lands near Sunnyside and Horse Canyon.<br><br>\n\n<u>Pronghorn:</u>  Private lands make up a small portion of pronghorn habitat, but pronghorn tend to use irrigated hayfields in late summer which are privately owned.  These areas can be avoided.  Some landowners provide access to hunters.  Please secure permission prior to hunting.  Pockets of private lands can be found in lower Coal Creek near Wellington, and portions of Icelander Wash southwest of Sunnyside.<br><br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer and elk:</u>  the vast majority of the high elevation summer and fall habitat is on private land.  There are a few small pockets of public land that can be found on the Cold Springs WMA east of Sunnyside, Cottonwood Ridge, and Harmon Canyon.  Make sure you have a map or GPS depicting land ownership as there is an abundance of private land and it is essential that you know where you are.<br>\n<br>\nBison:  A large part of the area where bison reside in Range Creek is managed by the Natural History Museum of Utah.  You must have an access permit to be on this property and it is walk in or horseback only.  Please visit https://nhmu.utah.edu/range-creek/visitor-permits to get an access permit.
