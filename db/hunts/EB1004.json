			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "A spike bull is a bull elk which has at least one antler beam with no branching above the ears. Branched means a projection on an antler longer than one inch, measured from its base to its tip. Spike bull hunts take place on most Limited Entry elk units. These units have healthy populations of elk and are managed for older age class bulls. The purpose of spike bull hunts is to provide hunting opportunity while removing excess bulls from the population. Removing spikes can maximize calf production because cows have less competition for available resources. High calf production maximizes both cow and bull hunting opportunities because more animals are added to the population each year. If you purchase a “spike bull” permit you may hunt on any of the “spike bull” units with a corresponding weapon type and season. See the big game guidebook for weapon type exceptions on “spike bull” units.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of Harvest:  The roadless area has four main drainages: West Willow Creek, She Creek, Little Creek, and East Willow Creek.  All of these drainages are good for camping.  The ridges that separate the drainages are: Went Ridge, and Little Creek Ridge.  There is a spring on Little Creek Ridge called Three Springs that has good drinking water.  This is a popular elk hunting area.  Other popular areas to find elk are: Santio Knolls, One Eye Canyon, Rivoguts Canyon, Fish Creek and Dry Fork Canyon.  \n\nThe elk are found more on the tops of the ridges and come down on the faces and in the canyons to feed and drink.  Most archery hunters have the most success early in the hunt sitting remote water holes.  As the hunt progress the elk start to rut and become easier to spot and stalk.   \n\nMigration Patterns:  You will find elk from one end of the roadless area to the other.  The elk will start feeling pressured toward the end of the archery hunt with increased rifle hunters scouting for their upcoming hunt.  Little Creek Ridge consistently holds a lot of elk.  The elk seem to prefer bedding down in the dark conifer timber during the day.  Towards the evening the elk will start to work their way onto the burned faces and points of the ridges.    \n\nScouting Tips:  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area.  Scouting is most effective late-summer.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bulls.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset).  There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of grass that is excellent for elk. Elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.       \n\nThere are very few signs on the trails.  I would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.  \n\nBehavior:  Once the bulls shed their velvet they will start to break up from their winter and summer bachelor herds.  They will usually water at least two times a day.  It is not unusual for elk to graze through the night.  As the hunt progresses and if colder weather moves in, the elk will start to come into the rut, or breeding season.  Before they start to herd the cows up the bulls are very susceptible to cow elk calls.  I have had success calling bulls in from far distances in the unit with the use of a cow call in early September.  As elk get closer to the rut they will become more vocal and will start to round up small herds of cows.  The larger bulls will usually try to keep their cows away from contending bulls.  It is normal to have one herd bull and other bulls surrounding the cows at a distance.  \n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> For the most part the elk will not show any migratory behavior during the archery, muzzleloader, and early rifle hunts. These elk will remain on summer ranges at elevations generally above 8,000 feet. Bulls will begin to migrate by the Late Season Any Weapon Hunt. Most bulls tend to move down in elevation on to steep ridges predominated by mountain mahogany shrubs. About 90% of the elk move east to winter and spend the winter months on the ridges west of SR-10 <br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> You can not go terribly wrong on this unit. There is excellent access to most of the unit. A popular route to learn the unit is Skyline Drive. Skyline Drive runs along the spine of the mountain range and provides access to most of the high elevation habitat on the entire unit. Learn country! There are over 12,000 elk on this mountain so there are small groups of elk with bulls in nearly every canyon with good habitat on the mountain. Listen for bugling activity and cow calls to locate elk. Also listen for domestic sheep. There are an abundance of sheep that will still be on the mountain during the September hunts. If you can hear sheep in the canyon below you, it is best to move to the next canyon as elk and sheep are rarely found in the same vicinity it seems. <br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. Glass the open south facing slopes where elk like to feed or small meadows near the canyon bottoms. Most bulls are only with cows during the rut. Before the rut they are in bachelor groups and then immediately after the rut they form their bachelor groups again. Keep this in mind as you plan your hunt. The archery, any weapon (early), and muzzleloader hunters will want to find cows. The any weapon (late) hunters should look for pockets of bachelor bulls. Typically only smaller bulls will be with cows during the late hunt. Elk rut: There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then. <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended Areas to look on the Central Mountains Manti Unit:</u> <br>\nUpper Fish Creek and it's tributaries. The tributaries include Gooseberry Creek, Silver Creek, C Canyon, and the Straight Fork. This is a roadless area on the north end of the unit. This area typically holds a lot of elk and had some prescribed fires recently that has improved elk habitat. It can be accessed from North Skyline Drive on the west or from Scofield Reservoir on the east. The bottom two miles of Upper Fish Creek is privately owned and in a CWMU Bear Ridge and Fish Creek Ridge These ridges have roads going down them. They are northwest of Scofield Reservoir. The bottom 2 miles of these ridges are privately owned. This is excellent habitat in the Pondtown Creek drainage on the north end of the unit. It is best accessed from North Skyline Drive. <br>\nTrough Spring Ridge-This is accessed off of SR-264 southwest of the town of Scofield. It is just above the Skyline Coal Mine. This is the ridge on the east side of Electric Lake. There are some small pockets of private land that are posted well but the majority of the acreage is Forest Service. Much of this ridge burned in the Seeley Wildfire in 2012 which has improved the elk habitat in this area. <br>\nGentry Mountain. This is accessed from SR-10 just north of the town of Huntington at Huntington Reservoir. Part of this mountain is privately owned and part of it burned in the Seeley Wildfire in 2012 Ford Ridge (Late Rifle Hunters Only) This area is the top of a steep canyon overlooking Spring Canyon west of Helper. It holds bachelor groups of bulls in the fall and winter. There are numerous private lands around so be very careful of where you are. There is ample public lands also. West of Skyline\n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u> Most of the harvest is from the bench above Ibapah. In recent years elk behavior has changed a little bit. Some of the elk have moved out to the flats west of Ibapah. Caution should be taken when hunting west of Ibapah. The Goshute Reservation Lands are not open to hunting and all fence lines look alike. Consult the the Goshutes for the latest map. <br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u> During the archery hunt I would expect to see herds of cows, calves, and spike bulls. The bulls will start breaking up from their bachelor herds. If there isn’t much pressure in the bottom of the canyons I would expect to see elk coming out in the evenings to drink from the creeks and springs. You may find elk centralized from Cold Springs to the Delle. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> If you never have seen the Deep Creeks you better go look before your hunt. A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area. Scouting is most effective mid-summer. If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bulls along with everyone else. This is a popular unit to put cameras out. In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset)unless pressured. Elk can start feeling pressure early with people scouting or recreating on ATV’s and may be hiding deeper in the trees. They are known to start moving after dark and go into the trees before light. Upper elevations elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nI would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area. Consult with the Goshute Reservation for info on the reservation boundaries. The reservation expanded a few years ago and the public maps are not up to date. If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The elk on the La Sal Mountains typically migrate from the West to the East and North. Many of the bulls will start this migration after the rut ends in early October. The majority of the elk will winter on or near the JB Ranch CWMU, or near the Utah/Colorado border. Elk also migrate off of the high mesa tops, into lower elevation valleys throughout the unit. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\nScouting Tips:</u> Start scouting prior to your hunt, in September. The elk probably won’t be in the exact same area during the hunt, but it will give you a chance to see how many elk you can expect to see on your hunt. The unit is very large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most feeding takes place in meadow openings. <br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Elk rut:</u> There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas La Sal Mountains Subunit: </u>\n<br>\nBar-A Creek- Northeast side of the mountain, large meadows with aspen stands mixed with conifers, great camping, nice roads, holds a good number of elk. \n<br>\nPine Ridge- This entire area is good for elk, timbered North slopes, aspen stands, great access, camping, nice roads, several different draws or canyons to hunt. \n<br>\nDeep Creek- No roads and limited access, great area for pack-in hunts, borders private lands in many spots, great area for elk. \n<br>\nDark Canyon- Higher elevation, borders some private lands, one good main road with several two-track roads splitting off, great camping, good place to glass for elk on the early season hunts. \n<br>\nLa Sal Pass- Lots of places to glass for elk, rolling meadows with timbered North facing slopes and large aspen stands, not a lot of cows, but does hold a good number of bulls. \n<br>\nNorth/South/Polar Mesas- These mesas are typically best for the late hunts, great for ATV’s, good place for late season hunts.",

Elk can be found from the bottoms of the valleys in the open sagebrush to the top of the mountain in the Pinions and Mahogany.  The Southwest Desert unit is a very large unit. It can be a difficult hunt. You may have days without seeing an elk because the density is low.  To increase your chances of seeing elk it is best to find water in good elk habitat.  There are several guzzlers and springs in this desert area, but even around these water sources there are very few elk. Some good areas to hunt are the following: \n\nStateline/Hamlin Valley – BLM and SITLA lands along the Utah/Nevada border from the Paradise to White Rocks areas. This area is very accessible with some larger blocks of private properties.\n\nIndian Peaks Range –  BLM, SITLA and DWR lands from Arrowhead Pass to Vance Pass.

The northeast portion of the mountain near Scofield Reservoir has a high percentage of private land on good elk habitat.  Most of these lands are managed under the CWMU program and can not provide hunter access as your permit will not be valid on those properties.  Other private properties require prior written permission before hunting.  Small pockets of private lands at high elevations can be found surrounding Electric Lake and on East Mountain.  Late Season any weapon hunters may encounter private lands in the Spring Canyon area west of Helper as well as upper Gordon Creek.\n \nWeather Conditions: The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until the first week of October.<br>\n<br>\n",

			"PRIV_TRIBE_LAND_ISSUES": "There are no tribal lands to contend with.  The vast majority of the early bull elk hunt habitat is on public land.  A few exceptions include the following areas.  The northeast portion of the mountain near Scofield Reservoir has a high percentage of private land on good elk habitat.  Most of these lands are managed under the CWMU program and can not provide hunter access as your permit will not be valid on those properties.  Other private properties require prior written permission before hunting.  Small pockets of private lands at high elevations can be found surrounding Electric Lake and on East Mountain.  Late Season any weapon hunters may encounter private lands in the Spring Canyon area west of Helper as well as upper Gordon Creek.\n \nWeather Conditions: The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until the first week of October.<br>\n<br>\n",
