			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Fish Lake/Thousand Lake unit is a very popular hunting area. Elevation ranges from some peaks above 11,600 feet to some valley floors near 5,000 feet. There are all types of vegetation and terrain. The good scenery, camping, fishing, and hunting draws many people to the area every fall.\n   <br><br>\n\nThe Fish Lake unit has a large herd of 5,600 elk. It is manages for a 5.5 to 6 year average age of harvest. In 2015, the average bull harvested was just under 6 years old. This unit can produce a few really large bulls, but in general you can expect to see a fair number of medium sized, mature bulls with a chance at some larger ones. On the earlier hunts, many elk can find refuge on private property which can be frustrating.   \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a large area and cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n<br>\nThe Fish Lake unit has a healthy bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears.  If you do have problems with bears please report them to the  Utah Division of Wildlife Resources\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for snow, rain, lightning, and both hot and cold temperatures.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions. The Archery and early rifle season can be very warm. Be prepared to get meat to a locker quickly or be prepared to cool meat as fast as possible to avoid spoilage.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Fish Lake/Thousand Lake unit is a very popular hunting area. Elevation ranges from some peaks above 11,600 feet to some valley floors near 5,000 feet. There are all types of vegetation and terrain. The good scenery, camping, fishing, and hunting draws many people to the area every fall.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>CWMU’s and Private property</u>\nThe Fish Lake Unit contains several large tracts of private property, several of which are CWMU’s that require a special permit in order to hunt. These ranches are prime elk habitat and many elk find refuge on them during the earlier hunts. This can be frustrating to hunters. Hunters are reminded that trespassing and hunting on these properties can result in large fines and loss of hunting privileges. To avoid problems have a good map and hunt well away from private property.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Hunting areas and seasons:</u>\nConcentrations of elk and bulls can change depending on the season you are hunting.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Archery</u>\nElk are generally concentrated in the higher elevations during the archery hunt (above 8,000 ft.).  The bulk of the herd tends to be in the higher elevations in the north/central part of the unit. Some good places to look are High Top Plateau, Mtn. Terrel, Mtn. Marvine, Mtn. Hilgard, Gooseberry area, Niotche, and UM Plateau. There are some elk on the Thousand Lake portion of the unit but not a large number until the late hunt. They will generally be in the higher elevations for this hunt. Elk will be easier to see in June and July as the bulls spend a lot of time grazing in the open meadows and hillsides. As the Archery season progresses the bulls will begin to split up and concentrate on the cow herds. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThere will be a lot of hunting/camping traffic along the main access roads. To find pressured elk you will need to get on foot and get to the more remote areas.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nThough the bulk of the elk will be in the aspen/conifer habitat, some elk will frequent the oak/pinyon country as long as there is water nearby. Sitting on water holes and wallows is often a good strategy in the lower and dryer country.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nBulls are generally quiet for the first half of the season. As the rut approaches in early September the bulls will begin to bugle and locating them may become easier. \n",
