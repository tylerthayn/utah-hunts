			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is one of the best bull elk limited entry units in the state.  The unit is managed for a 7.5 to 8 yr. old bull, which is what is being harvested, so we have an older age class of bulls in the population, although it can be a tough hunt.  Make sure that you are in good physical condition and spend plenty of time scouting prior to your hunt.  The Elk Ridge portion of the unit is flat and thick with vegetative cover and visual opportunities are limited.  Cow calling or bugling can prove to be very valuable in locating bulls during the early season hunts.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Flash floods and lightning strikes are very likely during inclement weather, make sure to watch the sky and plan accordingly.  Always let somebody know where you'll be, and when you expect to be back.  Cell phone service is somewhat limited throughout the unit.  Black bears are regularly seen on the San Juan unit.  Keep a clean camp and make sure to place all food and garbage in locations that bears cannot get into.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges and flash floods in the canyon bottoms.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The elk migration on the San Juan unit varies, depending on weather conditions.  Typical migration goes from high elevations in the summer and early fall to low elevations in the winter and early spring. Many of the bulls will start this migration after the rut ends in early October. The majority of the elk will winter on or near Dry Mesa, Salt Creek Mesa, Bridger Jack Mesa, Milk Ranch Pnt., Peter's Point and Devil's Cyn.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Start scouting in late June early July many of the bulls will be up high and in the open in large bachelor groups. They probably won’t be in the exact same area during the hunt, but it will give you a chance to see the type of bulls you can expect on your hunt. The unit is very large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads, access points and watering holes.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. \n<br>\n\nMost bulls are only with cows during the rut. Before the rut they are in bachelor groups and then immediately after the rut they form their bachelor groups again. Keep this in mind as you plan your hunt. The archery, any weapon (early), and muzzleloader hunters will want to find cows. The any weapon (late) hunters should look for pockets of bachelor bulls. Typically only smaller bulls will be with cows during the late hunt.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Elk rut: </u>There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas for the San Juan limited entry subunit:</u>\n<br>\n\n<i>Abajo Mountain</i>- Higher elevations include large alpine meadows with aspen/conifer stands surrounding, lower elevations contain oak stands with large sagebrush clearings, good camping, nice roads, holds a good number of elk.\n<br>\n<i>North Elk Ridge</i>- A good area for elk, timbered North slopes, aspen stands,  limited clearings for glassing, camping, nice roads, several different draws, canyons and mesa tops to hunt.\n<br>\n<i>South Elk Ridge</i>- Good roads on mesa tops, limited access to rugged canyons, great area for pack-in hunts (Dark Canyon).\n",
