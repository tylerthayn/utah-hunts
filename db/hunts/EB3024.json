A lot of the canyons and ridges have roads or ATV trails to provide access.  There are plenty of areas to hike and get away from the main roads.

			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n<br>\n\nThe Beaver Mountains has a moderate bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears.  If you do have problems with bears please report them to the DWR Southern Regional Office as soon as possible (435-865-6100).\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and high temperatures.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The majority of hunters choose to hunt the higher elevation areas during the early rifle hunt.  The areas around Big Johns flat and Big Flat hold large amounts of elk.  There are canyons and areas surrounding those areas where you can get out and hike to get away from people.  There is plenty of water on the mountain for the elk.  However as you hike you can find several unmarked springs.  The northern areas of the unit have recently been through an extensive burn.  As the burned area reestablishes vegetation it attracts large amounts of elk. \n\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns: </u> You will find elk from one end of the Beaver to the other.  The elk will start feeling pressured toward the end of the archery hunt with increased rifle hunters scouting for their upcoming hunt.  During the winter months the bulls prefer to stay in the highest elevations.  They will locate windswept south slopes and wait out the winter.  The cows and calves will migrate to lower elevations.  After the calving season you can find large herds of elk at higher elevation in grassy meadows.  Once the rut begins the bulls begin to herd up smaller herds of cows and the elk seem to spread out through the whole Beaver Range.   \n\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area.  Scouting is most effective late-summer to early fall.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bulls.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset).  There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of grass that is excellent for elk. Elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.\n\n<br>\nScouting during the summer is effective for learning the areas where you want to hunt.  I would not expect to see the same elk on the same ridge during the summer and also in the fall.  The elk do tend to move before the rut.  I would focus scouting efforts during the first of September.          \n\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>  The elk seem to prefer bedding down in the dark conifer timber during the day.  Towards the evening the elk will start to work their way onto the burned faces and points of the ridges.  \n\n<br>\nOnce the bulls shed their velvet they will start to break up from their winter and summer bachelor herds.  They will usually water at least two times a day.  It is not unusual for elk to graze through the night.  As the hunt progresses and if colder weather moves in, the elk will start to come into the rut.  Before they start to herd the cows up the bulls are very susceptible to cow elk calls.  I have had success calling bulls in from far distances in the unit with the use of a cow call in early September.  As elk get closer to the rut they will become more vocal and will start to round up small herds of cows.  The larger bulls will usually try to keep their cows away from contending bulls.  It is normal to have one herd bull and other bulls surrounding the cows at a distance.  \n\n<br>\nDuring this hunt it is effective to hunt water holes early on the hunt.  Later in the hunt it is more efficient to call and locate the bulls and try to get them to come to cow calls.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<u>General Information:</u>  This is one of the best elk hunts in the state of Utah.  Most hunters are able to look over or locate multiple mature bulls.  The Beaver mountain range provides great habitat for elk. You can find and hunt elk in all elevations on the mountain.  I would suggest hunting the areas where you like to hunt.  \n\n<br>\nThe Beaver Mountains are so large that it can be difficult to cover every area.  Some hunters find it best to scout drainage and hunt that drainage until they are ready to move on.  I would suggest bringing extra water, tires, and fuel.   \n",
