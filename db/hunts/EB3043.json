There are some ATV trails that start in low elevation areas and go part way up several canyons.  Many of the canyons have hiking trails that can help in accessing areas away from main roads.  The hunting pressure will drastically decrease after opening weekend. The large majority of the elk will be found on the West side of the unit. Bulls can be found all the way from Ebbs canyon on the North to Dog valley and Three creeks on the South. On this late hunt especially plan to spend a lot of time using optics in order to locate elk. The bulls will be mostly solitary or in small groups and can be tough to find.",
