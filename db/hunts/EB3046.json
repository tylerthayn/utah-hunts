			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a great unit for the opportunity to harvest a bull elk .  Typical harvested bulls on the unit score around 310\" to 330”, but a few bigger bulls are taken each year.  Make sure that you are in good physical condition and spend plenty of time scouting prior to your hunt.  Portions of the unit are extremely steep.  Cow calling or bugling can prove to be very valuable in locating bulls during the early season hunts.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Flash floods and lightning strikes are very likely during inclement weather, make sure to watch the sky and plan accordingly.  Always let somebody know where you'll be, and when you expect to be back.  Cell phone service is somewhat limited throughout the unit.  Black bears are regularly seen on the La Sal unit.  Keep a clean camp and make sure to place all food and garbage in locations that bears cannot get into.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges and flash floods in the canyon bottoms.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The elk migration on the La Sal Mountains varies, depending on weather conditions. Elk will typically migrate off of the high mountain and mesa tops, into lower elevations throughout the unit. Many of the bulls will start this migration after the rut ends in early October. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Start scouting in late June early July many of the bulls will be up high and in the open and in large bachelor groups. They probably won’t be in the exact same area during the hunt, but it will give you a chance to see the type of bulls you can expect on your hunt. The unit is very large with elk scattered across most of it. Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. \n<br>\n\nMost bulls are only with cows during the rut. Before the rut they are in bachelor groups and then immediately after the rut they form their bachelor groups again. Keep this in mind as you plan your hunt. The archery, any weapon (early), and muzzleloader hunters will want to find cows. The any weapon (late) hunters should look for pockets of bachelor bulls. Typically only smaller bulls will be with cows during the late hunt.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Elk rut:</u> There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas La Sal Mountains Subunit:</u>\n\n<br>\n<i>Bar-A Creek</i>- Northeast side of the mountain, large meadows with aspen stands mixed with conifers, great camping, nice roads, holds a good number of elk.\n<br>\n<i>Pine Ridge</i>- This entire area is good for elk, timbered North slopes, aspen stands, great access, camping, nice roads, several different draws or canyons to hunt.\n<br>\n<i>Deep Creek</i>- No roads and limited access, great area for pack-in hunts, borders private lands in many spots, great area for elk.\n<br>\n<i>Dark Canyon</i>- Higher elevation, borders some private lands, one good main road with several two-track roads splitting off, great camping, good place to glass for elk on the early season hunts.\n<br>\n<i>La Sal Pass</i>- Lots of places to glass for elk, rolling meadows with timbered North facing slopes and large aspen stands, not a lot of cows, but does hold a good number of bulls.\n<br>\n<i>North/South/Polar Mesas</i>- These mesas are typically best for the late hunts, great for ATV’s, good place for late season hunts.",
