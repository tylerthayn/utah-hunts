			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Monroe is a popular unit for hunting and outdoor recreation. There is ample public land with good road/trail access. Valley floors start between 5,000 – 6,000 feet with some of the peaks reaching near 11,000 ft in elevation. Habitat types include sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and aspen/conifer.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for snow, rain, lightning, cold and high temperatures.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions.  During some seasons very warm temperatures may occur. Hunters should be prepared to cool meat quickly to avoid wasting meat.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>General Considerations:</u>\nThe Monroe unit has long been considered a great unit to hunt elk. Good numbers of Mature bulls, beautiful scenery, and good access makes it a popular place to hunt. It is managed for an average age of harvested bull of 6.5-7yrs.\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Early Any Weapon season:</u> Elk use the entire Monroe unit. During the Early Any Weapon season the rut is in full swing. Bulls are usually very vocal, especially early in the morning. By this time, due to the rut and hunting pressure, some of the elk have started using the mid elevation oak and pinyon/juniper habitats.  Most of the bulls are with or at least near the cow herds. A good number of elk have also began to move south on the unit. The southern part of the unit will have increased numbers of elk during this season. Warm temperatures common during this time of year sometimes keep elk in the cooler canyon.\n<br><br>\n\nGenerally there are no other hunts during this season. As a result, hunters enjoy a quality hunt with little pressure from other hunters.\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Good areas to hunt:</u>\nThe central part of the unit is the most popular place for elk hunters for several reasons: There is really good camping and access, the terrain is mild, and the largest part of the elk herd resides there during the archery hunt. Elk can be found across the entire central part of the unit. Just about every meadow and canyon may have elk in them. Many people hunt this large area consisting of gentle terrain between the Dry Creek ranger station and the Koosharem ranger station. There are several large tracts of private property here. Consult maps to avoid conflicts with Private ground.\n<br><br>\n\nHunters should not overlook the many side canyons that lead from the top of the plateau down to the foothills. Elk use these because of the good feed and also they get less pressure as there are fewer roads. During this season there are generally significant numbers of elk using the agricultural fields near Koosharem, Greenwich, and Monroe. If you ask, many of these landowners may grant permission to hunt on their property or at least pass through. Generally the elk move onto public ground during daylight hours so they are accessible.\n\n<br><br>\n\nGood numbers of elk also use the north end of the mountain. Elk can be found near Hunter’s Flat, Big Lake, Magleby pass, and Monument peak. There are several sections of private ground in this area so be sure to know where you are. Make sure to check the mid-elevation areas.\n<br><br>\n\nA few elk have now moved down to the south end of the unit during this hunt. Elk will be on the Forshea Mountain area where the thick aspen stands are. There are also small groups of elk stretching from the Forshea to the Langdon mountain area.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u> Though most of the elk that spend the summer on Monroe also stay there for the winter. A significant number also migrate south to the Mt. Dutton unit. This movement usually begins in September and elk trickle south through November. Because of this, do not count on bulls being is the same place you may have scouted them in during the summer. Also, many elk now use the mid-elevation areas that have fewer roads and less pressure.\n<br><br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> June is a great time to begin scouting, as elk are less wary and there will be less people on the mountain. Elk will still be growing their antlers but will be easier to locate. The elk may move before this hunt but you will have an idea of what is in the area.   A scouting trip just before the season opens will tell you what areas the bulls and cow herds are using. A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for effective and efficient scouting in this area. \n<br><br>\n\n<u>Other Information:</u>  Hunters enjoy a high harvest rate on the Monroe unit. Hunters are usually able to locate quite a few mature bulls during scouting and hunting trips. This unit typically produces good mature bulls though not as many really large bulls as some nearby units that have more difficult terrain and access. \n",
