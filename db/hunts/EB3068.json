			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The elk on this unit are doing well, with nice bulls being harvested the past several years.  Habitat on Diamond Mountain consists of sagebrush, pinyon/juniper, pine, aspen, and lower elevation desert scrub.  This unit contains a Landowner Association and consists of about 35% private property.  The private property is posted and a GPS showing private/public property boundaries is recommended.  Even though the unit has private property, there is still 65% public land that is huntable. Public hunters should not expect to be allowed to hunt the private property.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically between the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable or very muddy.\n",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nElk in this unit move up and down in elevation throughout the year.  During normal winters, elk will move down off the rim to the north and south.  Bull elk will typically stay up higher in elevation in more inaccessible places.  In dry years, elk will stay on the top of Diamond through the winter.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nIn warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings.  Later in the season when there’s usually more water available, hunters do best glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot.  Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, elk are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  If it’s a dry year, they will be more concentrated around water sources, and these can sometimes be hunted successfully.  On average precipitation or wet years, elk won’t be as concentrated around water.  Elk can move long distances in short periods of time, especially if they are disturbed by vehicles or people.  Elk can be called in close for a shot during the rut.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Elk rut:</u><br>\nThe elk rut usually runs from mid-September to early October.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find elk:</u><br>\nElk are usually found in the higher elevations of the unit during the hunting season.  There are water sources across the unit in the form of stock ponds, guzzlers, creeks, and springs.  In warm and dry weather, elk can be found close to these water sources.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the South Slope, Diamond Mtn Unit:</u><br>\nGood areas to look for elk include Wild Mountain, Top of Crouse Canyon, Marshall Draw, Warren Draw, and Mail Draw.  Most of the ridges on this unit are public land and are accessible through public lands, although not always easily.\n \n",
