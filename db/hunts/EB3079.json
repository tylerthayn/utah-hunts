			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Most hunters plan on spending five days hunting in this remote area.  There are plenty of water sources so don’t plan on bringing much water in with you.  Some hunters who do not have much horse experience camp at the trail heads and hike in and out every day.  There are several guides and outfitters who work in this area.  I would plan on a very challenging and rewarding hunt.  Not many hunters can say they have killed a trophy bull in the true back country like this unit can provide.  \n\nCurrently there is no cattle grazing in this area, to allow stream bank restoration, and let the landscape heal after the massive fire.  There are native Colorado cutthroat trout in most of the streams.  There are 30-40 wild horses in this area.  I have seen anywhere from 30-70 bison on this unit.  It is not uncommon to see black bears in this area.  There is usually plenty of feed for horses, most sportsman hobble their horses; for a few hours a day.  \n\nThis area is patrolled quite frequently by DWR personnel.  Keep this in mind when you are transporting your game.  Try to make it easy to access the permit and tag on the animal.   ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The Biologist suggests handheld radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nThe Book Cliffs roadless area has a high bear population.  I recommend keeping a clean camp and putting your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears. If you do have problems with bears please report them to the DWR Northeast Regional Office as soon as possible (435 781-9453), or local the local dispatch center (435 789-4222).      \n\nThe Book Cliffs mountain range is one of the more remote areas in Utah.  The trails are very steep and challenging.  Every year sportsmen kill horses and mules in the roadless area.  I would suggest bringing horses that are in good physical condition.    \n\nIt is not uncommon to have thunderstorms, flash floods and have trails wash out.  If it rains hard it makes it difficult to navigate the trails, and the access roads.  Tire chains can come in very handy.    \n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with meat spoiling in the heat.  I would plan on hot weather and plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:  The roadless area has four main drainages: West Willow Creek, She Creek, Little Creek, and East Willow Creek.  All of these drainages are good for camping.  The ridges that separate the drainages are: Went Ridge, and Little Creek Ridge.  There is a spring on Little Creek Ridge called Three Springs that has good drinking water.  This is a popular elk hunting area.  Other popular areas to find elk are: Santio Knolls, One Eye Canyon, Rivoguts Canyon, Fish Creek, and Dry Fork Canyon.  \n\nThe elk are found more on the tops of the ridges and come down on the faces and in the canyons to feed and drink.  Most archery hunters have the most success early in the hunt sitting remote water holes.  As the hunt progress the elk start to rut and become easier to spot and stalk.   \n\nMigration Patterns:  During the archery hunt I would expect to see large herds of cows, calves, and spike bulls.  The bulls will start breaking up from their bachelor herds.  If there isn’t much pressure in the bottom of the canyons I would expect to see elk coming out in the evenings to drink from the creeks.  You will find elk from one end of the roadless area to the other.  The elk will start feeling pressured towards the end of the hunt with increased rifle hunters scouting for their upcoming hunt.  Little Creek Ridge consistently holds a lot of elk.  \n\nScouting Tips:  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area.  Scouting is most effective mid-summer.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bulls.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset).  There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of grass that is excellent for elk. Elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.       \n\nThere are very few signs on the trails.  I would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.  \n\nBehavior:  Once the bulls shed their velvet they will start to break up from their winter and summer bachelor herds.  They will usually water at least two times a day.  It is not unusual for elk to graze through the night.  As the hunt progresses and if colder weather moves in, the elk will start to come into the rut, or breeding season.  Before they start to herd the cows up the bulls are very susceptible to cow elk calls.  I have had success calling bulls in from far distances in the unit with the use of a cow call in early September.  As elk get closer to the rut they will become more vocal and will start to round up small herds of cows.  The larger bulls will usually try to keep their cows away from contending bulls.  It is normal to have one herd bull and other bulls surrounding the cows at a distance.  \n",
