			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Manti is the largest elk herd in Utah and has stable elk numbers.  Elk are distributed fairly evenly across the good habitat on the unit.  Elk typically remain at high elevations during the muzzleloader hunt.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until the first week of October. ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Migration Patterns: For the most part the elk will not show any migratory behavior during the archery, muzzleloader, and early rifle hunts.  These elk will remain on summer ranges at elevations generally above 8,000 feet.  Bulls will begin to migrate by the Late Season Any Weapon Hunt.  Most bulls tend to move down in elevation on to steep ridges predominated by mountain mahogany shrubs.  About 90% of the elk move east to winter and spend the winter months on the ridges west of SR-10\n\n\nScouting Tips:  You can not go terribly wrong on this unit.  There is excellent access to most of the unit. A popular route to learn the unit is Skyline Drive.  Skyline Drive runs along the spine of the mountain range and provides access to most of the high elevation habitat on the entire unit.  Learn country!  There are over 12,000 elk on this mountain so there are small groups of elk with bulls in nearly every canyon with good habitat on the mountain.  Listen for bugling activity and cow calls to locate elk.  Also listen for domestic sheep.  There are an abundance of sheep that will still be on the mountain during the September hunts.  If you can hear sheep in the canyon below you, it is best to move to the next canyon as elk and sheep are rarely found in the same vicinity it seems.\n\nBehavior: As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find elk. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well.  Glass the open south facing slopes where elk like to feed or small meadows near the canyon bottoms.\n\nMost bulls are only with cows during the rut. Before the rut they are in bachelor groups and then immediately after the rut they form their bachelor groups again. Keep this in mind as you plan your hunt. The archery, any weapon (early), and muzzleloader hunters will want to find cows. The any weapon (late) hunters should look for pockets of bachelor bulls. Typically only smaller bulls will be with cows during the late hunt.\n\nElk rut: There will typically be a little rutting activity starting the first part of September, with the peak of the rut being September 15th-the end of September. There will still be some rutting activity in October, but it will be winding down by then.\n\nRecommended Areas to look on the Central Mountains Manti Unit\n\nUpper Fish Creek and it's tributaries.  The tributaries include Gooseberry Creek, Silver Creek, C Canyon, and the Straight Fork.  This is a roadless area on the north end of the unit.  This area typically holds a lot of elk and had some prescribed fires recently that has improved elk habitat.  It can be accessed from North Skyline Drive on the west or from Scofield Reservoir on the east.  The bottom two miles of Upper Fish Creek is privately owned and in a CWMU\nBear Ridge and Fish Creek Ridge  These ridges have roads going down them.  They are northwest of Scofield Reservoir.   The bottom 2 miles of these ridges are privately owned.  This is excellent habitat in the Pondtown Creek drainage on the north end of the unit.  It is best accessed from North Skyline Drive.\nTrough Spring Ridge  This is accessed off of SR-264 southwest of the town of Scofield.  It is just above the Skyline Coal Mine.  This is the ridge on the east side of Electric Lake.  There are some small pockets of private land that are posted well but the majority of the acreage is Forest Service.  Much of this ridge burned in the Seeley Wildfire in 2012 which has improved the elk habitat in this area.\nGentry Mountain.  This is accessed from SR-10 just north of the town of Huntington at Huntington Reservoir.  Part of this mountain is privately owned and part of it burned in the Seeley Wildfire in 2012\nFord Ridge (Late Rifle Hunters Only)  This area is the top of a steep canyon overlooking Spring Canyon west of Helper.  It holds bachelor groups of bulls in the fall and winter.  There are numerous private lands around so be very careful of where you are.  There is ample public lands also.\n\nWest of Skylin",
