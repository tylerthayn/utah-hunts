			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Fish Lake/Thousand Lake unit is a very popular hunting area. Elevation ranges from some peaks above 11,600 feet to some valley floors near 5,000 feet. There are all types of vegetation and terrain. The good scenery, camping, fishing, and hunting draws many people to the area every fall.<br>\n<br>\nThe Fish Lake unit has a large herd of 5,600 elk. It is manages for a 5.5 to 6 year average age of harvest. In 2015 the average bull was just under 6 years old. This unit can produce a few  really large bulls, but in general you can expect to see a fair number of medium sized, mature bulls with a chance at some larger ones. On the earlier hunts many elk can find refuge on private property which can be frustrating.   \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a Large area and cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\n\nThe Fish Lake unit has a healthy bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears.  If you do have problems with bears please report them to the  Utah Division of Wildlife Resources\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for snow, rain, lightning, and both hot and cold temperatures.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions. The Archery and early rifle season can be very warm. Be prepared to get meat to a locker quickly or be prepared to cool meat as fast as possible to avoid spoilage.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "67.6~5000 - 5900~5450~~~5.5–6.0~6.7~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Early Rifle:</u>\nElk are generally concentrated in the higher elevations during the early rifle hunt (above 8,000 ft.).  The bulk of the herd tends to be in the higher elevations in the north/central part of the unit. Some good places to look are High Top Plateau, Mtn. Terrel, Mtn. Marvine, Mtn. Hilgard, Gooseberry area, Niotche, and UM Plateau. There are some elk on the Thousand Lake portion of the unit but they can be difficult to find.<br>\n<br>\n\nThe elk will not be as easy to find as they were earlier in the year. During this hunt the rut is in full swing. Locating bulls by their bugles early and late in the day and even at night is a good strategy. These elk hear a lot of bugles and can be difficult to call in.  A few more elk may have moved down into the oak brush habitats during this hunt, so don’t overlook it.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Muzzleloader:</u>\nThis hunt also occurs during the elk rut. Bulls are still vocal but a little more wary as they have already been hunted.  Try locating bulls with bugles or cow calls but don’t expect many to come into the calls. After locating the elk try stalking to get into range. The majority of the elk will still be in the areas they used during the early season, though some movement may have occurred. The elk will be sticking close to the trees or not even leaving cover if ample feed exists under the trees. This hunt overlaps with the muzzleloader buck deer hunt, so there will be other hunters in the field.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u> From late October to early November many of the elk on the unit move to lower elevations. A large number of the elk head east to their wintering grounds on Mytogi, Last Chance, Red and Clear Creeks, Tidwell Slopes and Thousand Lake. Some elk will move south off of the unit onto the Parker Plateau. On the rest of the unit the elk drop down to lower elevations all around the unit.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> To see a lot of bulls, late June and July are great times to scout while elk are using the open meadows and hillsides. Many of these bulls will have moved by the time the hunting seasons arrive but you will get a good idea of what caliber of bulls are in the area. Good binoculars and spotting scope help you cover a lot of ground. One last trip just before your hunt will let you know where the elk are. For the early hunts concentrate on the conifer/aspen habitats and for the later hunt hit the oak brush/pinyon, mahogany areas. \n",
