Hunter densities are lowest during the archery and late season rifle hunts.  This permit allows you to have the best of both worlds.  See descriptions for the other Central Mountains, Manti bull elk hunts for descriptions on where to find elk.  Generally speaking during September most elk will be at high elevations above 8500 feet near Skyline Drive.  Skyline Drive transverses the entire mountain range is an excellent way to look at a lot of country.  Bulls during these early hunts will be in small groups mixed in with cows and calves.  During the late hunts, many bulls move down in elevation on to mahogany slopes at around 8000 feet.  This hunt can be very weather dependent.  With mild weather elk may still be on summer habitats near the top of the mountain, however, with some significant snow, bulls will often migrate to winter ranges early in the season.  Good late season hunt locations to look are Horn Mountain, Trail Mountain, Ford Ridge, and Gentry Mountain.",

			"PRIV_TRIBE_LAND_ISSUES": "There are no tribal lands to contend with.  The vast majority of the early bull elk hunt habitat is on public land.  A few exceptions include the following areas.  The northeast portion of the mountain near Scofield Reservoir has a high percentage of private land on good elk habitat.  Most of these lands are managed under the CWMU program and can not provide hunter access as your permit will not be valid on those properties.  Other private properties require prior written permission before hunting.  Small pockets of private lands at high elevations can be found surrounding Electric Lake and on East Mountain.  Late Season any weapon hunters may encounter private lands in the Spring Canyon area west of Helper as well as upper Gordon Creek.\n \nWeather Conditions: The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until the first week of October.<br>\n<br>\n",
