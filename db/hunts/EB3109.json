			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Nebo unit has pretty tough terrain in many locations where you find elk.  Hunters are either faced with straight up or straight down hikes so good physical condition for hunters is a must.  As already noted, the north portion of the Nebo unit is restricted from ATV use so hunters with horses or mules will have the advantage.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is fair over most this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The Biologist suggests handheld radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Depending on the season be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road and trail conditions.  Most hunters struggle with meat spoiling in the heat especially during the archery season so in anticipation of hot weather plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The majority of hunters choose to hunt the higher elevation areas during the early rifle hunt. The areas around the Nebo Loop Road being most popular is an excellent place to start. Elk can be seen from a distance by glassing the ridges and canyons from the overlooks on the Loop Road.  Since ATV use is not permitted on the north Nebo (that portion of the Nebo that is north of SR 132) there are canyons and trails where you can get out and hike to get away from people. There is plenty of water on the mountain for the elk. However as you hike you can find several unmarked springs. Wildfires have affected the habitat on both the east and west sides of the unit As the burned area reestablishes vegetation it attracts large amounts of elk. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u> You will find elk from one end of the Nebo to the other. The north portion of the Nebo has the greater percentage of the elk population.  The south portion of the Nebo unit (that portion that is south of SR 132) has much fewer elk but do not count that out as an opportunity to find a nice bull. The elk will start feeling pressured toward the end of the archery hunt with increased rifle hunters scouting for their upcoming hunt. During the winter months the bulls prefer to stay in the highest elevations. They will locate windswept south slopes and wait out the winter. The cows and calves will migrate to lower elevations. After the calving season you can find large herds of elk at higher elevation in grassy meadows. Once the rut begins the bulls begin to herd up smaller herds of cows and the elk seem to spread out. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area. Scouting is most effective late-summer to early fall. If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bulls. In the hot early fall temperatures expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset). There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of grass that is excellent for elk. Elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs. \nScouting during the summer is effective for learning the areas where you want to hunt but don't expect to see the same elk on the same ridge during the summer and also in the fall. The elk do tend to move before the rut so focus scouting efforts during the first of September. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> The elk seem to prefer bedding down in the dark conifer timber during the day. Towards the evening the elk will start to work their way onto the burned faces and points of the ridges. \nOnce the bulls shed their velvet they will start to break up from their winter and summer bachelor herds. They will usually water at least two times a day. It is not unusual for elk to graze through the night. As the hunt progresses and if colder weather moves in, the elk will start to come into the rut. Before they start to herd the cows up the bulls are very susceptible to cow elk calls. As elk get closer to the rut they will become more vocal and will start to round up small herds of cows. The larger bulls will usually try to keep their cows away from contending bulls. It is normal to have one herd bull and other bulls surrounding the cows at a distance. During this hunt it is effective to hunt water holes early on the hunt. Later in the hunt it is more efficient to call and locate the bulls and try to get them to come to cow calls. \n\n",
