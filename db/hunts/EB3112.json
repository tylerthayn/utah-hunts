			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Monroe is a popular unit for hunting and outdoor recreation. There is ample public land with good road/trail access. Valley floors start between 5,000 – 6,000 feet with some of the peaks reaching near 11,000 ft in elevation. Habitat types include sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and aspen/conifer. This unit is managed for an average age of harvest bulls of 6.5-7 yrs.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Archery, Muzzleloader, and Early Any Weapon:</u>\nThe central part of the unit is the most popular place for elk hunters for several reasons: There is really good camping and access, the terrain is mild, and the largest part of the elk herd resides there during the archery and early any weapon, and Muzzleloader seasons. Elk can be found across the entire central part of the unit. Just about every meadow and canyon may have elk in them. Many people hunt this large area consisting of gentle terrain between the Dry Creek ranger station and the Koosharem ranger station. There are several large tracts of private property here. Consult maps to avoid conflicts with Private ground.\n<br><br>\n\nHunters should not overlook the many side canyons that lead from the top of the plateau down to the foothills. Elk use these because of the good feed and also they get less pressure as there are fewer roads. During these seasons there are generally significant numbers of elk using the agricultural fields near Koosharem, Greenwich, and Monroe. If you ask, many of these landowners may grant permission to hunt on their property or at least pass through. Generally the elk move onto public ground during daylight hours so they are accessible.\n<br>\n<br>\nGood numbers of elk also use the north end of the mountain. Elk can be found near Hunter’s Flat, Big Lake, Magleby pass, and Monument peak. There are several sections of private ground in this area so be sure to know where you are. Make sure to check the mid-elevation areas.\n<br>\n<br>\nThere are some elk on the south end of the unit. Elk will be on the Forshea Mountain area where the thick aspen stands are. There are also small groups of elk stretching from the Forshea to the Langdon mountain area. Elk numbers on the south end grow as the seasons progress. Many elk move to the south end and then some even jump over to the Mt. Dutton unit.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Late Season:</u>\n Elk use the entire Monroe unit. During the Late Any Weapon season generally the bulls have separated from the cow herds. Though bulls may occasionally bugle they are generally quiet. Long range glassing is important for finding the bulls on this hunt. Many of the bulls spend this season high on ridges far from roads. A fair number of elk have left the unit by migrating south to Mt. Dutton. The bulls will be spread out across the entire unit in small bachelor groups. If snows are deep most of the elk will be forced off of the flatter terrain on the top of the unit and will be on south facing slopes. If snows are light they could be anywhere.\n<br><br>\n\nGenerally there are no other hunts during this season. As a result, hunters enjoy a quality hunt with little pressure from other hunters.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Monroe unit is a long mountain unit running north and south with the top being a plateau with more gentle terrain. Many of the bulls in November live along the rim and the side canyons of the plateau. Bulls really tend to like ridges with thick mahogany.\n<br>\n<br>\nNorth end – Hunter’s Flat, The Circle, Bear Valley, and Little Creek.\n<br>\nEast side – Drainages west of Burrville and Koosharem, including: Blue Peak, Indian Peak, upper Box Creek. Also check the steep canyons south of Greenwich between Brown’s canyon and Pine canyon.\n<br>\n\nSouth End – This end will have bulls on the edges of the Forshea. There is a lot of pinyon/juniper on the extreme south end that holds a few bulls. Also, the country between Dry Creek and Twin Peaks will hold bulls.\n<br>\n\nWest side – Good places to find groups of bulls include Marysvale Peak area, Hunts lake, and the roadless drainages east of the town of Monroe.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u> Though most of the elk that spend the summer on Monroe also stay there for the winter. A significant number also migrate south to the Mt. Dutton unit. This movement usually begins in September and elk trickle south through November. Because of this, do not count on bulls being is the same place you may have scouted them in during the summer. Also, many elk now use the mid-elevation areas that have fewer roads and less pressure. Though there are plenty of bulls on the unit this time of year, realize that there are  not as many as there were in earlier seasons.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Bulls in the later seasons may not be where you found them in the summer or early fall. The best way to scout for the late hunt is the several days just before the hunt.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nA good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for effective and efficient scouting in this area. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Other Information:</u>  Hunters enjoy a high harvest rate on the Monroe unit. Hunters are usually able to locate quite a few mature bulls during scouting and hunting trips. This unit typically produces good mature bulls though not as many really large bulls as some nearby units that have more difficult terrain and access. \n",
