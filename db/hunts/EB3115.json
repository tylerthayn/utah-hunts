			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This elk herd has seen a reduction in cow numbers the past several years.  Average age of bulls has decreased and is currently below objective.  This is a tough hunt; elk move back and forth across state lines.  330+ size bulls are rare.  Elk hunters should expect to see deer hunters.  This unit also sees a lot of tourism due to the Green River and Flaming Gorge Reservoir.  There is a Landowner Association in this unit and the majority of the private property is towards Colorado and Wyoming state lines. There was a fire this summer on the north and east sides of Goslin Mountain.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Due to recent storms, several roads in the 3 Corners vicinity have washed out and are impassable to any vehicle, including side by sides and ATVs.  Please do not harm the habitat by trying to drive off road around wash outs.  Driving off road is illegal.<br>\n<br>\nCellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically between the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for rain, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable or very muddy.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nElk in this unit move back and forth across state lines quite regularly.  Cow elk are sensitive to hunting pressure.  Success rates on this unit vary widely by year depending on where the elk are.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\n<br>\nIn warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings.  Later in the season when there’s usually more water available, hunters do best glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot.  Visibility on this unit is high due to the lack of trees.  Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, elk are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  If it’s a dry year, they will be more concentrated around water sources, and these can sometimes be hunted successfully.  On average precipitation or wet years, elk won’t be as concentrated around water.  Elk can move long distances in short periods of time, especially if they are disturbed by vehicles or people.  Elk can be called in close for a shot during the rut.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Elk rut:</u><br>\nThe elk rut usually runs from mid-September to early October.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find elk:</u><br>\nElk are found throughout much of the unit.  There are water sources across the unit in the form of stock ponds, guzzlers, creeks, and springs.  In warm and dry weather, elk can be found close to these water sources.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the North Slope, Three Corners:</u><br>\nGood areas to look for elk include Bare Top, Goslin Mountain, Home Mountain, Bender Mountain, and Dutch John Mountain.\n \n",
