			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a Limited Entry hunt unit and is managed for the harvest of 4.5-5.0 year old bulls. There are several CWMUs on this unit and access to those properties will only be allowed with the appropriate permit issued for the specific CWMU. This unit encompasses aspen, open sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and desert scrub. 60% of land where hunters can expect to see elk in the unit is private land. Hunters should receive written permission from private landowners prior to the start of the hunts if they wish to hunt private property.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit. Satellite phones do work in the area. A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return. Few services exist west of Snowville - the Grouse Creek store is the only public gas station until Montello, Nevada; Wendover, Utah/Nevada; or Oakley, Idaho.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat. Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes. Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area. Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October. Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Elk in this unit move back and forth across Nevada, Idaho, and Utah state lines. The majority of the elk are near agricultural fields during the summer months and will move west into Nevada during the winter. Sometimes early season snow storms will push the elk out of the country earlier than normal. In warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings. Later in the season when thereâ€™s usually more water available, hunters do best either glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot or stalking elk through the trees. Visibility on this unit is variable due to dense trees and open rolling sagebrush hills. Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts. Elk are found throughout much of the unit, but are concentrated on the Grouse Creek Mountain Range. There are water sources across the unit in the form of stock ponds, creeks, and springs. In warm and dry weather, elk can be found close to these water sources and irrigated agricultural fields. Good areas to look for elk include west of Hwy 30 along the Grouse Creek Mountain Range, Lynn Narrows, West of Grouse Creek, and from Keg Springs to Rocky Pass. Be aware that a portion of this unit was removed in 2021 to create the Box Elder, Sawtooth unit.\n",
