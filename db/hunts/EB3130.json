			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a Limited Entry hunt unit and is managed for the harvest of 4.5-5.0 year old bulls. There are no elk CWMUs on this unit, but there is a Landowner Association. This unit encompasses aspen, open sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and desert scrub. Hunters can expect to see elk on private land within the unit. Hunters should receive written permission from private landowners prior to the start of the hunts if they wish to hunt private property. This unit is part of a cooperative interstate hunt agreement and allows hunters to hunt on the Nevada portion of the unit. Likewise, Nevada hunters can hunt on the Utah side.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit. Satellite phones do work in the area. A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return. Services are available in Grouse Creek, Montello, Nevada, or Wendover, Utah/Nevada.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat. Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes. Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area. Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October. Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Elk in this unit move back and forth across the Nevada and Utah state lines, but an interstate hunt agreement exists allowing Utah hunters to hunt Nevada's unit 091. The majority of the elk are near agricultural fields during the summer months and will move west into Nevada during the winter. Sometimes early season snow storms will push the elk out of the country earlier than normal. In warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings. Later in the season when there is usually more water available, hunters do best either glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot or stalking elk through the trees. Visibility on this unit is variable due to dense trees and open rolling sagebrush hills. Elk will use the irrigated agricultural fields at the base of the east side of the mountain. Elk are found throughout much of the unit, but are concentrated up Bettridge Canyon, Patterson Pass, Governor's Spring, and TL Bar Ranch. ",
