			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Elk use all habitats from the bottom of the valleys to the top of the mountains.  The Southwest Desert, North Unit is 96+% public land, but hunters should be aware of the private lands and learn the boundaries.  Please be respectful of private lands and other hunters. ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Hunters should be prepared with extra gas and water this unit is remote and there are no services available.  This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" or \"InReach\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Expect warm and dry conditions though out most seasons on this unit.  The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Usually warm temperatures and monsoonal moisture dominate the weather pattern. Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Bulls can be found throughout the unit. Elk can be found from the bottoms of the valleys in the open sagebrush to the top of the mountain in the Pinions and Mahogany.  The unit is a very large unit. It can be a difficult hunt. You may have days without seeing an elk because the density is low.  To increase your chances of seeing elk it is best to find water in good elk habitat.  There are several guzzlers and and few springs in this desert area, but even around these water sources there are very few elk. Some good areas to hunt are the following: <br>\n\nWah Wah Range- BLM and SITLA lands from Wah Wah summit to Crystal Peak. This area is covered heavily with pinion and juniper.  There are no springs in this area.  All water sources are artificial (Guzzlers).<br>\n<br>\nFrisco Range- BLM and SITLA lands from Frisco Summit to Black Rock Pass.  There are a few perennial springs and a some guzzlers in this area. <br>\n\nCrickets -BLM and SITLA lands east of Sevier dry lake.  Most water sources in this area are guzzlers and livestock tanks.<br>\n<br><br>\n\nBurbank Hills - BLM and SITLA lands east of Garrison near the Utah/Nevada stateline.  There are several guzzlers and a few livestock tanks in this area.  Elk will cross highway 21 and off the unit to use the Ag fields in the Burbank and Garrison areas. ",
