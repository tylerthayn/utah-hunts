			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The majority of the elk are on the Deep Creek Mountains. These mountains are a classic Basin and Range mountain, with steep and rocky terrain. They look like a mountain sprouting out of the desert. The Deep Creeks have sagebrush benches that transition into juniper woodlands, with aspen and conifer at the highest elevations. Water is limited and very critical for these elk. Please be aware of private land, review your maps frequently to avoid trespass issues especially on the Goshute Tribal Lands. Foot hunters who plan to hunt in the upper elevations should plan on staying up there for several days. It is just too far to come down every day.  Hunting with horses is possible with some difficulty from the steep terrain and limited grass and water, scout the area before taking horses in. Review your maps frequently to avoid trespass issues on the Goshutes.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis area is patrolled quite frequently by DWR and BLM personnel.  Keep this in mind when you are transporting your game and driving an ATV.  Try to make it easy to access the permit and tag on the animal.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with limited access.  There are few water sources so plan on bringing extra water in with you. Cellular phones will not work.  Digital cell phones may show a bar but will not connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The Biologist suggests handheld radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return. Bring an extra spare tire, water and gas. There are not facilities. Wendover is the closest (60 miles).\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is not uncommon to have thunderstorms, flash floods and have trails wash out.  If it rains hard it makes it difficult to navigate the trails.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with meat spoiling in the heat.  I would plan on hot weather and plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u> Most of the harvest is from the bench above Ibapah. In recent years elk behavior has changed a little bit. Some of the elk have moved out to the flats west of Ibapah. Caution should be taken when hunting west of Ibapah. The Goshute Reservation Lands are not open to hunting and all fence lines look alike. Consult the the Goshutes for the latest map. \n<br>\nElk are found top to bottom. Most archery hunters have the most success early in the hunt sitting on remote water holes. As the hunt progress the elk start to rut and become easier to spot and stalk.   \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>  During the archery hunt I would expect to see herds of cows, calves, and spike bulls.  The bulls will start breaking up from their bachelor herds.  If there isn’t much pressure in the bottom of the canyons I would expect to see elk coming out in the evenings to drink from the creeks and springs.  You may find elk centralized from Cold Springs to the Delle. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  If you never have seen the Deep Creeks you better go look before your hunt. A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting elk in this area.  Scouting is most effective mid-summer.  If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bulls along with everyone else. This is a popular unit to put cameras out.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset)unless pressured. Elk can start feeling pressure early with people scouting or recreating on ATV’s and may be hiding deeper in the trees. They are known to start moving after dark and go into the trees before light.    \n<br>\nUpper elevations elk spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.        \n<br>\n<br>\nI would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area. Consult with the Goshute Reservation for info on the reservation boundaries. The reservation expanded  a few years ago and the public maps are not up to date.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.  ",
