			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "One of the best units in the state but one of the hardest to hunt. The area is very large and some places are very remote. Pre-season scouting is crucial to finding the elk you want to pursue.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Depending on where and when you hunt you could find limited access and roadless areas. Be prepared for some rough roads and rocky trails. Always carry plenty of water and tell someone where you are hunting. There are some remote areas on this unit. It is very easy to become disoriented especially when hiking.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for variable conditions. Check weather forecasts often.  Snow storms occasionally occur during this hunt. Monsoon rains sometimes bring moisture every afternoon. Be prepared for muddy road conditions. ATVs may be needed for access.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Bulls will be found in every habitat type during this hunt. Weather and temperature play a huge role in the timing of the rut or timing of migration movements. Excessive pressure will cause bulls to become nocturnal.  Don't assume that you can hunt large areas since the unit very large and rugged. It's better to get to know an area well rather than guess the right place to be due to trying to cover too much country during scouting trips. This is a difficult unit to glass due to large areas of thick timber.",
