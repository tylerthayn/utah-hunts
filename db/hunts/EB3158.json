Pay attention to patches of mahogany and other shrubs that provide nutrition and protection for elk during the winter. Bulls can be found almost anywhere around the unit including both the East and West sides of the range. Good places to start might include Pine creek, Wildcat, Indian creek on the Beaver side, and Sargent Mtn and Ten mile on the East side.",
