			"LAND_OWNERSHIP": "Most of the summer and fall elk habitat is on public lands managed by the Forest Service.  There are however large tracts of private lands on the northeast portion of the unit in the area surrounding Scofield Reservoir.  Late Season Rifle hunters will have a little more private land to deal with as bulls transition to lower elevations.",
			"WMA_IN_UNIT": "Gordon Creek, Lower Fish Creek, Starvation, Dairy Fork, Lake Fork, Birdseye, Lasson Draw, White Hill, Black Hill, Bald Mountain, Sixmile, Miller Manti Face, Nine Mile, Twelve Mile, Willow Creek.  Most of these properties are on winter range for elk.",
			"CAMPGRND_INFO": "All Campgrounds on this unit are managed by the US Forest Service.  This unit is on the Manti La Sal National Forest.  Camping outside of official campgrounds is also permitted on most of the Forest. Please direct all questions regarding campground availability and other camping questions to the US Forest Service.  Maps and camping regulations are available on their websites at http://www.fs.usda.gov/mantilasal",

Please direct all questions regarding which roads and trails ATVs can be operated on to the US Forest Service at http://www.fs.usda.gov/mantilasal\n\nThere are also several roads and ATV trails on land managed by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. All vehicles and ATV’s must stay on designated roads and trails on these lands.",
			"ATV_VEH_ACCESS": "See above",
			"PRIV_TRIBE_LAND_ISSUES": "There are no tribal lands to contend with.  The vast majority of the early bull elk hunt habitat is on public land.  A few exceptions include the following areas.  The northeast portion of the mountain near Scofield Reservoir has a high percentage of private land on good elk habitat.  Most of these lands are managed under the CWMU program and can not provide hunter access as your permit will not be valid on those properties.  Other private properties require prior written permission before hunting.  Small pockets of private lands at high elevations can be found surrounding Electric Lake and on East Mountain.  Late Season any weapon hunters may encounter private lands in the Spring Canyon area west of Helper as well as upper Gordon Creek.\n \nWeather Conditions: The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until the first week of October.<br>\n<br>\n",
