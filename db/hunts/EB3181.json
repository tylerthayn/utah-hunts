You'll still see some rut activity, but it's typically smaller bulls trying to breed smaller groups of cows. The central and southern portions of the unit currently hold the majority of the elk. Good starting points to look can be in the North and South forks of Chalk creek, Meadow creek, and the South side of the Corn creek drainage. There is overlap with the general season spike elk hunt so expect to see other hunters while in the field. The pahvant has decent access and is a very glassable unit; you should plan to spend a lot of time behind optics.",
