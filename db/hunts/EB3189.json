			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Panguitch Lake elk herd is currently managed for 1300 wintering elk across the unit.  Recent surveys and estimates suggest the population is approximately 1200.  \n\nSubstantial summer range exists on the Markagunt Plateau which is heavily forested.  There are also several mid-elevation areas across the unit that bull elk will use as summer range.  Elk occupy most all suitable habitat throughout the unit. The unit had a significant burned in 2017 and has opened alot of new habitat for ELK, look for elk in the burn. ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Panguitch Lake unit offers substantial truck and ATV access.  Cellular phone coverage within this hunt boundary is generally good but there are areas within the hunt boundary with little or no coverage.  \n\nMake sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nPlan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, as well as warm weather conditions.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "~~~~~~~~~~~~",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:  Nursery groups of cow elk can be observed generally very early in the morning or right before sunset.  During warmer times of the day, elk will be staying cool in the forested areas and will be more difficult to observe.  Focus on areas with high densities of aspen near water sources. Look for elk in the burn.\n\nMigration Patterns:  \n\nAll elk in this hunt boundary will migrate but these movements are generally not observed until late October and November.  Migration from summer ranges may be dependent on fall storms and weather conditions.    \n\nScouting Tips:\n\nA good spotting scope and binoculars will be helpful.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate public lands and access points and hiking trails.   \n\nBehavior:  Elk will be on summer range and will begin to rut in September with cooler weather patterns.\n",
