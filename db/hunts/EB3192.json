There are also many smaller unimproved roads that get you into good country from the frontage road along I-70. Access to the eastern side of the unit is via hwy 72. Roads that fork from hwy 72 that get you into good county include the Last Chance road, Road #206 that gets you onto the Thousand Lake Mountain, road #036 that takes you past Mill Meadow Reservoir and to Fish Lake.  There are many ATV trails and smaller unimproved roads that fork off of Hwy 72. The main access on the south end is SR-25 to Fish Lake via SR-24.   The west side is accessed via several dirt roads including the Hancock Flat road off of SR-25,  Road #053 that forks off of SR-24 gets you into the Rex Reservoir, and the Lost Creek country.   ",
