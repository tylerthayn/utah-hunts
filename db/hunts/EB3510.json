Lower elevations are in the north along Nine Mile Canyon which ranges from 6800 feet to 7200 feet and forms part of the unit's north boundary.  Pole Canyon on the westside ranges from 7200 feet to 8200 feet.  On the eastside Cow Canyon ranges from 6800 feet to 8600 feet.  The most common elevation is 8000 feet but ranges from 6700 feet to 9200 feet with an elevation difference of 2500 feet.  Fifty-five percent (55%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7200 feet and 8600 feet an elevation difference of1 1400 feet.<br><br>The Conover-Jensen Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit land is mostly covered with Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22), 35%.  This Aspen Forest and Woodland is mostly in the south and southwest of the CWMU.  Colorado Plateau Pinyon-Juniper\tWoodland (36) covers close to 22% of the land.  This Pinyon-Juniper Woodland occurs primarily in the north and northeast.  Scatted throughout the CWMU is Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62) making up about 16%.<br><br>One of the Conover - Jensen Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, SUNNYSIDE (428474), is 14.6 km southeast of the southeast edge of the CWMU.  SUNNYSIDE has eighty-three (83) years of records, 1905 - 1988.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 4.13 inches, but it can be as high as 7.39 inches or as low as 1.66 inches.

There can also be 1 day with precipitation greater than or equal to 1.00 inch.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 12.6 inches but can be as high as 31.0 inches.  FALL temperature at SUNNYSIDE averages 49.2 degrees F. but can be as high as 89.0 degrees F. or as low as 8.0 degrees F.
