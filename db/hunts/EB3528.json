			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is located southeast of Grouse Creek.  Habitat types include open sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, sub-alpine forest, and irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural fields.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.  Few services exist west of Snowville - the Grouse Creek store is the only public gas station until Montello, Nevada or Wendover, Utah/Nevada.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Elk in this unit move back and forth between Ingham Canyon and Keg Springs on both the east and west sides of the range.  The majority of the elk will use agricultural fields during the summer months and will move west into the Grouse Creek Valley or east near Rosette at night and return to the CWMU during the day.  Sometimes early season snow storms will push the elk out of the country earlier than normal. In warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings.  Later in the season when thereâ€™s usually more water available, hunters do best either glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot or stalking elk through the trees.  Visibility on this unit is variable due to dense trees and open rolling sagebrush hills.  Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts",
