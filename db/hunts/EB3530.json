			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Jacobs Creek Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is west of Morgan, Utah on the Morgan County side of the Davis â€“\nMorgan County boundaries. Higher elevation are on the west side of the Unit, ranging from 9200 feet in the north to 9300 feet in the middle, then dropping to 9000 feet in the south. Jacobs Creek is a drainage in the northern part of the Unit. It ranges from 8600 feet to 5000 feet. Petersen Creek flows west to east and has three forks. The Right Fork starts about 8800 feet elevation, 7500 feet for the Middle Fork, and 7600 feet for the Left Fork. Petersen Creek exits the Unit at 5000 feet. Another west to east drainage that has three forks is Dalton Creek. The Right Fork of Dalton Creek starts at 7400 feet, the Middle Fork at 7700 feet and the Left Fork at 7500 feet.  After converging into Dalton Creek the forks exit the Unit at 5500 feet. Two other drainages are Smith Creek ( 8200 feet to 6600 feet) and Line Creek ( 8700 feet to 6800 feet) drain the Unit.  The most common elevation is 5700 feet but ranges from 4900 feet to 9300 feet with an elevation difference of 4400 feet.  Fifty percent (50%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 6300 feet and 8400 feet an elevation difference of 2100 feet.\n<br><br>Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane Shrubland (41) is the dominant land cover typeon the Jacobs Creek Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU). It is mostly located onthe north and east sides of the Unit. Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22) is another major land cover type on the Unit, it runs down the middle and toward the west side of the Unit. In between the Shrubland and Forest and Woodland are patches of Inter-Mountain\nBasins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62). Rocky Mountain Montane Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland (32), Rocky Mountain Montane Dry-Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland (30), and Rocky Mountain Subalpine Mesic Spruce-Fir Forest and Woodland (28) add to the Forest and Woodland character of the Unit. Rocky Mountain Lower Montane Riparian Woodland and Shrubland (79) intermixes with lower elevation Forest and Woodland types. \n<br><br>One of the Jacobs Creek Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, FARMINGTON (422721), is 6.6 KM west of the west edge of the CWMU.  FARMINGTON has seventy-two (72) years of records, 1893 - 1965.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 4.61 inches, but it can be as high as 7.83 inches or as low as 1.18 inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 17 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 11 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 3 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  There can also be 1 day with precipitation greater than or equal to 1.00 inch.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 6.8 inches but can be as high as 20.5 inches.  FALL temperature at FARMINGTON averages 51.0 degrees F. but can be as high as 98.0 degrees F. or as low as -1.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 30 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 2 days above 90 degrees F.",
