The Right Fork Little Red Creek (8800 feet to 7200 feet) and Currant Creek (7200 feet to 6800 feet) form the west boundary of the Little Red Creek CWMU. There are four hollows that cut the Unit. Mill Hollow which ranges from 7900 feet to 8800 feet, Rough Hollow ranging from 7900 feet to 9000 feet, Grass Hollow ranging from 7300 feet to 9400 feet, and Ringwood Hollow ranging from 7400 feet to 8900 feet.  The most common elevation is 9200 feet but ranges from 6900 feet to 9700 feet with an elevation difference of 2800 feet.  Fifty-one percent (51%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 7600 feet and 8900 feet an elevation difference of 1300 feet.<br><br>The cover type most common on the Little Red Creek CWMU is Inter-Mountain Basins Montane\nSagebrush Steppe (62).
