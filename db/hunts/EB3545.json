			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is located southwest of Grouse Creek.  Habitat types include open sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and irrigated and non-irrigated agricultural fields.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.  Few services exist west of Snowville - the Grouse Creek store is the only public gas station until Montello, Nevada or Wendover, Utah/Nevada.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The majority of the elk will use higher elevations of the CWMU through the summer months and move lower into irrigated agricultural fields towards the end of summer.  Sometimes early season snow storms will push the elk west out of the country and into Nevada earlier than normal.  In warm weather, hunters do best hunting water sources in mornings and evenings.  Later in the season when thereâ€™s usually more water available, hunters do best either glassing for elk and then working to get close for a shot or stalking elk through the trees.  Visibility on this unit is variable due to dense trees and open rolling sagebrush hills.  Elk are most active in the early mornings and late afternoons, which are the best times for scouting elk prior to and during the hunts.",
