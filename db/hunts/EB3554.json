			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "South Canyon CWMU is south of Avon, Utah and southwest of Porcupine Reservoir. The south shore of Porcupine Reservoir is part of the northern boundary of the Unit. Higher elevation range between 7000 in the west to 8800 feet in the east. The Unit is cut near the middle by two major drainages, South Fork Little Bear River and Davenport Creek. Both of these drainages range from 5100 feet to 5600 feet. Clay Valley is in the west at 6100 feet elevation.  The most common elevation is 6000 feet but ranges from 5100 feet to 8800 feet with an elevation difference of 3700 feet.  Fifty-seven percent (57%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 6000 feet and 7800 feet an elevation difference of 1800 feet.<br><br>Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62) and Rocky Mountain Bigtooth Maple Ravine Woodland (23) occur on the South Canyon Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) in almost equal proportions. Rocky Mountain Aspen and Woodland (22), Rocky\nMountain Montane Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland (32), Rocky Mountain Montane Dry-Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland (30), and Colorado Plateau Pinyon-Juniper Woodland (36) add to the Forest and Woodland character, while Southern Rocky Mountain\nMontane-Subalpine Grassland (71) and Invasive Perennial Grassland (119) add to the Grassland character. For the Woodland and Shrubland character, Inter-Mountain Basins Mountain Mahogany Woodland and Shrubland (44) and Rocky Mountain Lower Montane\nRiparian Woodland and Shrubland (79) are representative.<br><br>One of the South Canyon Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, HARDWARE RANCH(423671), is about 15.0 km southwest from the southwest edge of the CWMU.  HARDWARE RANCH has thirty-five (35) years of records, 1956 - 1991.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 3.47 inches, but it can be as high as (not available) inches or as low as (not available) inches.  During the 91-day FALL period, 12 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inchs of precipitation, 7 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 2 days of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages (not available) inches but can be as high as (not available) inches.  FALL temperature at HARDWARE RANCH averages (not available) degrees F. but can be as high as 94.0 degrees F. or as low as -5.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 36 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and no days above 90 degrees F.",
