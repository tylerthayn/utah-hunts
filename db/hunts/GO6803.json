			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit has a population estimate of ~160 mountain goats. This is a difficult and physically demanding hunt.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Mountain goat habitat on this unit is very remote and hard to access. Appropriate precautions should be taken. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents. Mountain goats live in very steep, cliffy, treacherous terrain.  Do not shoot a mountain goat in an area where you cannot safely retrieve it. You may need to wait until it moves to a safer spot before you can harvest the animal.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind, and heat. It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon. Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges where mountain goats live. Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area. Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until through the first week on October. It is recommended that hunters do not wait until the very end of the hunt to go out hunting.  At high elevations, there is a very real chance of a snowstorm that will not melt out until spring after the first week of October.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\nMost of the mountain goats in this unit can be found near Loafer Peak, Bald Mountain, and Mount Nebo above or near 11,000 feet. Scouting trips are highly recommended.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Mountain goat hunting requires a lot of glassing in cliff faces and \"Bollies.\"  Mountain goats do move during the year, so where you find them in the winter and summer may not be where they are in the fall.  Some areas they stay fairly consistently all year while others they move quite far.  Scouting is most effective the last couple weeks before the hunt opens when they are more likely to stay in the same general area.  Goats do have areas they like and stay in the same general area but they can simply walk over the ridge and be gone for a day or two.  What they can hike in minutes can take you all day. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>\nLike other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  Most of the time they are in the cliffs or on rocky ridge tops, etc... occasionally move down into the trees so don't overlook those areas too.  Mature Billies often like to hang out in very steep, rocky, cliffs by themselves or in small groups of two and threes.  Nannies with kids prefer areas that are a little less steep are open and green where they find better feed.  Nannies and kids are usually in larger groups of five to fifty.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Billy vs. Nanny:</u>\nIt is very difficult to tell the difference between a billy and a nanny mountain goat from a distance.  Please review the Rocky Mountain Goat Hunt Orientation packet to learn how to properly identify mountain goats <a href=\"https://dwrapps.utah.gov/wex/examBorder.jsp?content=loginForm.jsp&formstat=0\" target=\"_blank\">https://dwrapps.utah.gov/wex/examBorder.jsp?content=loginForm.jsp&formstat=0</a>.\n<br>\nThere are also other informational resources including this video produced by the Rocky Mountain Goat Alliance<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8gUaMx8G7I\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8gUaMx8G7I</a><br>\n<br>\n\nWhile permits are either sex permits, hunters are encouraged to take billies and avoid harvesting a nanny with a kid.
