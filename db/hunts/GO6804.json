			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a difficult hunt with very limited motorized vehicle access.  Mtn. goat habitat on this unit is very remote and hard to access.  Appropriate precautions should be taken. Mtn. goats live in very steep, treacherous terrain.  Do not shoot a mtn. goat in an area where you cannot safely retrieve it.   You may need to wait until it moves to a safer spot before you can harvest the animal.  Wasting of wildlife is not excusable simply because you chose to shoot it in a location you couldn't safely get to.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": " Cellular phone coverage is very spotty at best in the high country on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The Biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges where Mtn. Goats live.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until through the first week on October.  It is recommended that hunters do not wait until the very end of the hunt to go out hunting.  At high elevations, there is a very real chance of a snowstorm that will not melt out until spring after the first week of October.  \n",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "When it comes to mtn. goats, most hunters consider the beautiful white cape to be the main trophy and they're concerned about the hair quality of the goats.  I've heard from numerous taxidermists that the hair quality of Uinta Mountain mtn. goats is as good at the opening of the hunt as most other mtn. goat units have at the end of the hunt.  The Uinta Mountains goats hair up quite quickly after shedding their winter coats.  Billies shed first in the summer and also hair back up first in the fall.  I recommend against waiting until the very end of the hunt to have good hair for the cape.  I would suggest the end of September and first few days of October to be a great time to hunt the Uintas for a good cape on a goat.  Mountain  Scouting trips are highly recommended and good quality binoculars and spotting scopes are essential.  Scouting is most effective the last couple weeks before the hunt opens when they are more likely to stay in the same general area.  Goats do have areas they like and stay in the same general area but they can simply walk over the ridge and be gone for a day or two.  What they can hike in minutes can take you all day. \n<br>\n<br>\nLike other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  Most often they are in found in the cliffs or on rocky ridge tops. Mountain goats on this unit occasionally move down into the trees so don't overlook those areas.  Mature Billies often like to hang out in very steep, rocky, cliffs.  Nannies with kids prefer areas that are a little less steep and with rubble rock or green patches in rock where they find better feed.  You can often guess whether it's a billy or a nanny just by the habitat it's in.\n<br>\n<br>\nGoats on the Chalk Creek/Kamas unit migrate very little during the winter. Goats can be found at or above 9000’ in elevation throughout most of the year on this unit. Mountain goats can be found throughout the hunt on Bald Mountain, Notch Mountain and Haystack, as well as the Whiskey Lake area.",
