			"POPULATION_OBJECTIVE": "There is no population objective for individual hunt units but the objective for the entire Uinta Mountains is 1,500 counted adult Mtn. Goats.",
			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "100% of the mountain goat habitat in this hunt unit is within the High Uintas Wilderness Area where motor vehicles are prohibited and access is difficult and remote.<br>\nMtn. goats live in very steep, cliffy, treacherous terrain.  Do not shoot a mtn. goat in an area where you cannot safely retrieve it.   You may need to wait until it moves to a safer spot before you can harvest the animal.  Wasting of wildlife is not excusable simply because you chose to shoot it in a location you couldn't safely get to.<br>\nWhere to find mountain goats:\nAccess to almost all of the mountain goat habitat is by foot or horseback only and is very remote.  Mountain goat hunting is very physically demanding.  Mountain goats live in steep cliffy areas, usually above tree line.  Hunting can be very difficult, particularly in this hunt unit.  Mountain goats are usually found in small groups or by themselves scattered across the cliff faces and the “bollies” between drainages and across the summit of the Uintas.  Goats are well distributed in cliffy habitat across the entire unit.  Goats are found in every drainage.  <br>\nMountain goat rut:The mtn. goat rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. so it does not really affect the hunt. <br>\nRecommended areas in the High Uintas Central:Goats are found across the spine of the Uintas.  Billies in particular seems to prefer the spine of the Unitas.  The Red Castle Peak area is probably the most popular area to hunt on this unit because there are almost always goats in the area.  To the east of Red Castle, Flat Top Mtn also always has good numbers of goats along both sides up in the cliffs.  \nOn the South Slope, there are always mtn goats on the east side of the Lake Fork drainage but those areas can be difficult to access due to lack of trails on the Lake Fork side.  There are goats from Swasey's Hole to Garfield Basin too.  Another popular area is Swift Creek area and Yellowstone Canyon.  Further east in the Uinta Canyon drainage, the Krebs Creek area has been popular, and up high on the sides of Mt. Emmons and above the Chain Lakes Basin.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a wilderness hunt.  Mtn. goat habitat on this unit is very remote and hard to access.  Appropriate precautions should be taken.\nDue to the Wilderness Area restrictions and the remoteness of mtn. goat habitat on this unit cellular phone coverage is very spotty at best in the high country on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents but bear incidents in the Wilderness area have been rare in the past.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges where Mtn. Goats live.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until after the first week on October.  It is recommended that hunters do not wait until the very end of the season to go out hunting.  At high elevations, there is a very real chance of a snowstorm that will not melt out until spring after the first week of October.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"CURRENT_POP": "Around 250 Mtn. Goats on the Central Hunt Unit.  Goat numbers on this hunt unit have been fairly stable since 2009.",
			"CLASSIFICATION_DATA": "25 kids/100 adult goats in 2014.  Ranges from 15-34.",
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Coat Condition: When it comes to mtn. goats, most hunters consider the beautiful white cape to be the main trophy and they're concerned about the hair quality of the goats.  I've heard from numerous taxidermists that the hair quality of Uinta Mountain mtn. goats is as good at the opening of the hunt as most other mtn. goat units have at the end of the hunt.  The Uinta Mountains goats hair up quite quickly after shedding their winter coats.  Billies shed first in the summer and also hair back up first in the fall.  I recommend against waiting until the very end of the season to have good hair for the cape.  There is very little difference in hair quality in one or even two weeks.  I would suggest the end of Sept. and first few days of October to be a great time to hunt the Uintas for a good cape on a mtn goat.    \nLocation of harvest: Mtn. goats are famous for being able to take a bullet and still be able to get up and run.   Wounded goats will often run towards cliffs to escape and then fall and damage or destroy much of meat, horns and cape.  Choose your shot wisely.  Make sure it is in a safe place to harvest your goat.  If you cannot safely retrieve the goat, do not shoot.   \nMigration Patterns: Some of the mtn. goats on the High Uintas Central unit do migrate down in elevation for the winter.  During the winter mtn. goats can be found down low in every drainage across the South Slope.  Most of these animals move back to the north for the summer and fall.  This migration is usually after the hunt ends so it does not normally effect the hunt.  Some of the goats do not migrate down in elevation and can be found all winter near the top of the Uintas.  We found a radio collared nanny that spent the winter near Kings Peak at almost 13,000' all winter and she survived.  They often move to south facing ridges or windblown faces for the winter.\nScouting Tips: In the Uintas locating mtn. goats is the hardest part of the hunt.  Scouting trips are highly recommended.  Take your fishing pole along and enjoy the High Uintas.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Lots of glassing of cliff faces and \"Bollies.\"  Mtn. goats do move during the year, so where you find them in the winter and summer may not be where they are in the fall.  Some areas they stay fairly consistently all year while others they move quite far.  Scouting is most effective the last couple weeks before the hunt opens when they are more likely to stay in the same general area.  Goats do have areas they like and stay in the same general area but they can simply walk over the ridge and be gone for a day or two.  What they can hike in minutes can take you all day. \nBehavior: Like other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  Most of the time they are in the cliffs or on rocky ridge tops, etc... but they occasionally move down into the trees so don't overlook those areas too.  Mature billies often like to hang out in very steep, rocky, cliffs.  Nannies with kids prefer areas that are a little less steep and with rubble rock or green patches in rock where they find better feed.  You can often guess whether it's a billy or a nanny just by the habitat it's in.\nBilly vs Nanny: It is very difficult to tell the difference between a billy and a nanny mtn. goat from a distance.  Please review the Rocky Mountain Goat Hunt Orientation packet to learn how to properly identify mtn. goats <br>\nhttps://dwrapps.utah.gov/wex/dbconnection.jsp?examnbr=510923   <br>\nThere are also other orientation slide shows available on various state fish and game websites:http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/hunting/goathunting/pdfs/goat_long_quiz_for_web.pdf<brhttp://fwp.mt.gov/hunting/planahunt/huntingGuides/msg/mountainGoatGuideBrochure.html\nWhile permits are either sex permits, hunters are encouraged to take billies and make sure you do not harvest a nanny with a kid.
