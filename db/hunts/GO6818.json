			"SAFETY_CONS": "Mtn. goat habitat on this unit is very remote and hard to access. Appropriate precautions should be taken. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return. Camps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents but bear incidents. Mtn. goats live in very steep, cliffy, treacherous terrain. Do not shoot a mtn. goat in an area where you cannot safely retrieve it. You may need to wait until it moves to a safer spot before you can harvest the animal. Wasting of wildlife is not excusable simply because you chose to shoot it in a location you couldn't safely get to. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat. It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon. Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges where Mtn. Goats live. Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area. Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until through the first week on October. It is recommended that hunters do not wait until the very end of the hunt to go out hunting. At high elevations, there is a very real chance of a snowstorm that will not melt out until spring after the first week of October. ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Coat Condition: When it comes to mtn. goats, most hunters consider the beautiful white cape to be the main trophy and they're concerned about the hair quality of the goats. I've heard from numerous taxidermists that the hair quality of Uinta Mountain mtn. goats is as good at the opening of the hunt as most other mtn. goat units have at the end of the hunt. Billies shed first in the summer and also hair back up first in the fall. I recommend against waiting until the very end of the hunt to have good hair for the cape. There is very little difference in hair quality in one or even two weeks. I would suggest the end of Sept. and first few days of October to be a great time to hunt for a good cape on a mtn. goat. \n\nLocation of harvest: Mtn. goats are famous for being able to take a bullet and still be able to get up and run. Wounded goats will often run towards cliffs to escape and then fall and damage or destroy much of meat, horns and cape. Choose your shot wisely. Make sure it is in a safe place to harvest your goat. If you cannot safely retrieve the goat, do not shoot. Most goats are found around Box Elder peak and around Lake Hardy.\n\nMigration Patterns: Some of the mtn. goats do migrate down in elevation for the winter. During the winter months mtn. goats can be found down low in drainage across the Wasatch front. These animals move back to the top of the mountains for the summer and fall. This migration is usually after the hunt ends so it does not normally interfere with the hunt. Goats most often move to south facing ridges or windblown faces for the winter.\n\nScouting Tips: In locating mtn. goats is the hardest part of the hunt. Scouting trips are highly recommended. A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential. Mtn. Goat hunting requires a lot of glassing in cliff faces and \"Bollies.\" Mtn. goats do move during the year, so where you find them in the winter and summer may not be where they are in the fall. Some areas they stay fairly consistently all year while others they move quite far. Scouting is most effective the last couple weeks before the hunt opens when they are more likely to stay in the same general area. Goats do have areas they like and stay in the same general area but they can simply walk over the ridge and be gone for a day or two. What they can hike in minutes can take you all day. \n\nBehavior: Like other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day. Most of the time they are in the cliffs or on rocky ridge tops, etc... occasionally move down into the trees so don't overlook those areas too. Mature Billies often like to hang out in very steep, rocky, cliffs by themselves or in small groups of two and threes. Nannies with kids prefer areas that are a little less steep are open and green where they find better feed. Nannies and kids are is big group of five to fifty. Avoid hunting in these big nanny groups. You can often guess whether it's a billy or a nanny just by the habitat it's in. \n\nBilly vs. Nanny: It is very difficult to tell the difference between a billy and a nanny mtn. goat from a distance. Please review the Rocky Mountain Goat Hunt Orientation packet to learn how to properly identify mtn. goats https://dwrapps.utah.gov/wex/examBorder.jsp?content=loginForm.jsp&formstat=0. \n There are also other orientation slide shows available on various state fish and game websites: http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/hunting/goathunting/pdfs/goat_long_quiz_for_web.pdf and http://fwp.mt.gov/hunting/planahunt/huntingGuides/msg/mountainGoatGuideBrochure.html\n While permits are either sex permits, hunters are encouraged to take billies and make sure you do not harvest a nanny with a kid.
