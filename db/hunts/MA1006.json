			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat. It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon. Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges. Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area. Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until through the first week on October.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Scouting Tips: Most moose are seen near rivers, streams, ponds, or lakes, focus your efforts near these areas. Later in the fall they will move into thick, brushy areas of oak brush and mahogany. Moose are very spread out on these subunits, so it is important to cover a lot of area. It is a great place to camp in the summer to scout and learn the roads and trails.\n\nBehavior: As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find moose. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. Moose are typically a solitary animals.<br>\n<br>\nRecommended areas Wasatch West Subunit:\nAmerican Fork Canyon- The canyon road takes you from the mouth of AF canyon east to Heber City. This area has a lot of moose. Look around Casacade Springs area.\nStrawberry Reservoir- Look along all streams feeding into Strawberry Reservoir, such as Strawberry River, Coop Creek, Mud Creek and Indian Creek and Trout Creek. These areas are not a high density area.\nSalt Lake County- All canyons on the east side of the valley have moose in them, such as Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons, Mill Creek, and Lambs Canyon. You can hunt with any weapon east on I-15 for cow moose.\nOther canyons to look in- Squaw Peak road, Right Hand Fork of Hobble Creek, Diamond Fork, Sheep Creek and Tie Fork. Not a lot of moose in these areas.",
