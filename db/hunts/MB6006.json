			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The moose population on this unit is stable to slightly increasing. Recent collar data suggests a healthy population with near average recruitment.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past in this unit.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.\n<br>\n<br>\nMoose can be unpredictable and dangerous if you encroach into their space.  Females can be protective of young and may charge if they perceive you as a threat.  Males can be defensive, especially during the rut.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightning if you’re crossing high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>\nMoose are very large animals and difficult to haul long distances.  They are often found near or in water.  Do not shoot if you cannot retrieve the animal where it may go down, such as in a lake or stream.  Choose your shot wisely; you may have to wait for it to move to a better location.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nMoose do not show a definite migration pattern on this unit..  They are not as dependent on water sources during the winter months.  Snow depth also does not seem to affect where they are located.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  \nScouting trips are highly recommended in order to become familiar with the area.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential. Plan to spend a lot of time hiking in areas away from human disturbance. Bull Moose can move long distances, especially during the rut when they are in search of cows so you may not see the same moose on different scouting trips. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>\nLike other wildlife, moose are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of the day.  They are often found in mountain riparian areas, near lakes and streams, with willows or aspen.  During the rut, bulls and cows will call to attract mates.  This can be useful in finding bulls in the thick vegetation.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Moose rut:</u>\nThe moose rut usually runs during September and October.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas:</u>\nHigh elevation riparian and wet meadow habitat types, away from human disturbance.\n\n",
