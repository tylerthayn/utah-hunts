			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit encompasses a variety of terrain ranging from low desert to high elevation mountains.  The majority of the moose are found in the higher elevation terrain, while some are found along rivers and streams in low elevation habitat.  The Vernal subunit is a general season deer and elk hunt unit and Diamond Mountain is a limited entry deer and elk unit.  These units are heavily utilized by hunters during these seasons with many people camping out on public lands.  This is a tough hunt due to low moose densities.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty in the mountains on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past in this unit.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.<br>\n<br>\nMoose can be unpredictable and dangerous if you encroach into their space.  Females can be protective of young and may charge if they perceive you as a threat.  Males can be defensive, especially during the rut.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightning if you’re crossing high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u><br>\nMoose are very large animals and difficult to haul long distances.  They are often found near or in water.  Do not shoot if you cannot retrieve the animal where it may go down, such as in a lake or stream.  Choose your shot wisely; you may have to wait for it to move to a better location.  If you cannot retrieve the moose, do not shoot; this is not an excuse for wasting game.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nMoose do not show a definite migration pattern on this unit.  They are not as dependent on water sources during the winter months.  Snow depth also does not seem to affect where they are located.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nIn the Uintas locating a bull moose is the hardest part of the hunt.  Scouting trips are highly recommended so you become familiar with the unit and know the size of bull you will most likely harvest.  Take your fishing pole along and enjoy the mountain lakes and streams.  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Bull moose can move long distances, especially during the rut when they are in search of cows so you may not see the same moose on different scouting trips.  Moose do move during the year, so where you find them in the winter and summer may not be where they are in the fall.  When the rut starts, a bull moose may move many miles in one day so don’t count on finding the same bull in an area on consecutive days. <br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, moose are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of the day.  Most of the time, they are found in mountain riparian areas near lakes and streams, most often where there are willows or aspen.  During the rut, bulls and cows will call to attract mates.  This can be useful in finding bulls in the thick vegetation they are often in.  Bulls are sometimes attracted to thrashing willows if they think it’s another bull.  You may be able to use this trick to lure them into a different area for a better shot.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Moose rut:</u><br>\nThe moose rut usually runs during September and October.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find moose:</u><br>\nThe majority of the moose are found west of Hwy 191 on this unit.  East of Hwy 191 is generally more open along the streams and moose are easier seen than west of Hwy 191, but moose are still found west of Hwy 191.  During the hunt, moose will generally be found along streams and in aspen stands, but they may also be found in conifer stands moving between areas.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the Diamond Mtn/Vernal:</u><br>\nGood areas to hunt include Dodd’s Hollow, Gull Lake(Lake Mountain), White Rocks drainage, Blanchard Mountain, Mosby Mountain, Little Brush Creek, along Hwy 191, top of Crouse Canyon, Marshall Draw, Warren Draw, Tolliver Creek, and Mail Draw.  These areas are all on public lands.  Occasionally a bull can be found along the Green River in Browns Park, but they are usually younger bulls.  There is private property in this unit so you should receive written permission from landowners if you wish to hunt their property.\n \n",
