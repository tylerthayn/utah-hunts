			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a Once in a lifetime hunt.  The quality of the bulls on this unit is average.  Moose can be found during this hunt anywhere across the unit from the highest elevations in the Wilderness area to the lowest along the Duchesne River corridor.  Hunters should be aware of Ute tribal lands and learn the boundaries.  Public hunting is not permitted on tribal Lands.  There are no CWMUs on this unit.  \n<br>\nMoose are found primarily along stream corridors and near lakes and ponds.  They can also be found in forested areas and brushy areas away from water.\n<br>\nThis unit includes the South Slope portion of the High Uintas Wilderness Area.  The wilderness can provide a remote hunt with very few hunters but moose can be hard to locate.  Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed.  It is generally Lodge Pole Pine with little understory vegetation.  Road access on the remainder of the unit is limited to mostly canyon bottoms due to the steepness of the terrain.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for hot, dry, or rainy, lightening, windy and even snowy conditions.  Early snow storms occur often during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy conditions.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u>\nMoose on this unit can be found almost anywhere during the hunt.  This herd generally move down in elevation for the winter.  Most of the moose winter on Ute Tribal Lands or on lower elevation slopes on Forest Service lands.  They also winter in river bottoms etc...  Some moose are found on ridgetops and fairly high elevation during the winter. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Moose rut:</u>\nThe moose rut on this unit usually peaks the end of Sept. and early Oct.  The rut is usually dropping off by the end of the hunt.  Some hunters are successful calling in bulls during this hunt, but most bulls are harvested simply by spot and stalk style hunting. During the rut, bull moose will cover a lot of ground looking for cows that are in heat.  Finding a bull in one canyon does not mean he will still be there the next day when they really get rutty.   When on the rut and looking for cows, bulls will often make a low grunting noise while they travel.   \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the South Slope, Yellowstone:</u>\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. \n<br>\n\nThe Wilderness Area can provide a remote hunt with few hunters but is very tough to hunt and it can be hard to locate moose.  Much of the habitat in the high country is fairly sterile without much feed.  It is generally Lodge Pole Pine with little understory.  Moose in the wilderness are generally found near lakes and along the stream corridors. \n<br>\n\nDuring the hunt, most of the moose are found near water but can be also be found in brushy or timbered areas.  \n<br>\n\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit):\n<br>\n<i>Mirror Lake Hwy</i>- Hwy 150 is the west boundary of the hunt, closest to the Wasatch front\n<br>\n<i>Soapstone/Iron Mine</i>- good road access, closer to the Wasatch Front\n<br>\n<i>North Fork of the Duchesne</i>- limited road access\n<br>\n<i>Log Hollow</i>- must cross tribal Lands to access, rough roads\n<br>\n<i>Rock Creek</i>- paved road access, steep areas, be aware of tribal boundary\n<br>\n<i>Bear Wallow</i>- steep terrain, be aware of tribal boundary\n<br>\n<i>Lake Fork/Moon Lake</i>- paved road access, some private property to be aware of\n<br>\n<i>Yellowstone</i>- rough roads, be aware of tribal boundary\n<br>\n<i>77 Flat/Burnt Mill</i>- gravel roads, a little flatter area, be aware of tribal boundary\n<br>\n<i>Dry Gulch</i>- very rough road, steep terrain, be aware of tribal boundary on the east \n<br>\n<i>Uinta Canyon</i>- tribal lands down low, steep terrain\n<br>\n<i>Painter Basins</i>- wilderness area, very remote\n<br>\n<i>Elk Horn Loop</i>- gravel roads that go almost to the summit of the Uinta Mountains, lots of opportunity to scatter out, good access to the high country\n<br>\n<i>Whiterocks Canyon</i>- Whiterocks River is the eastern unit boundary, steep terrain\n   \n",
