The project area is located in Utah County, approximately 30 miles east southeast of Spanish Fork, Utah, and northwest of Soldier Summit from Highway 6.  The burn unit includes approximately 5,927 acres. This prescribed burn is part of a vegetation project that included mechanical treatment in 2013 through 2017.HWY 150\nUpper Provo, approximately five miles east of Kamas on the north side of Hwy 150 (Mirror Lake HWY). between Upper Setting and Norway Flat roads. The burn area reaches to the top of the ridge above Shingle Creek. The burn window is sometime between September 1st and December 1st.\nWest Fork of the Duchesne drainage. Burn area is ten miles west of Hwy 35 near Hanna, Ut. Burning will be targeted on the south side of the river from the reservoir to Little West Fork. The burn extends from the river bottom to the ridge. The burn window is sometime between September 1st and December 1st.

It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightening while hunting on high ridges.  Early fall snow storms occur regularly in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off, within a day or two until through the first week on October. ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Most moose are seen near rivers, streams, ponds, or lakes, focus your efforts near these areas. Later in the fall they will move into thick, brushy areas of oak brush and mahogany. Moose are very spread out on these subunits, so it is important to cover a lot of area. It is a great place to camp in the summer to scout and learn the roads and trails.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find moose. This is when most rutting activity will take place as well. Moose are typically a solitary animal, groups of bulls are uncommon until late fall and winter. Bull moose can, and will travel long distances during the rut in search of cows. This is important to know, because areas where you saw bulls in the summer might not be where they will be in the fall, however areas where you saw cows in the summer may be good places to find bulls during the rut.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Moose rut:</u> There will typically be a little rutting activity starting middle of September, with the peak of the rut being the end of September through the middle of October. There should be rutting activity throughout the entire hunting season. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Areas to Hunt:</u>\n<br>\n\n <u>Recommended areas Currant Creek Subunit:</u>\n<br>\n<i>Currant Creek Drainage</i>- This entire area is great for moose, timbered North slopes, large aspen stands, lots of ponds, creeks, streams, and lakes. Great access, camping, nice road, several different draws or canyons to hunt(Layout Canyon, Big Dry Hollow, Low Pass Creek, Race Track), can hold moose.\n<br>\n<i>North Fork Deep Creek/Water Hollow</i>- very few roads, great area for horseback hunts, land managed by UDWR, borders private land in many spots.\n<br>\n<i>Wildcat WMA</i>- UDWR land, borders private, lots of roads, highest density of moose on the subunit.\n<br>\n<i>West Fork Duchesne</i>- Big area, road access, limited ATV access, timbered North slopes, large aspen stands, lots of water.\n<br>\n<i>Tabby Mountain WMA</i>- the North slope is best, ponds on top, UDWR land, great for ATV’s.\n<br>\n<i>Red Creek Drainage</i>- Great area for moose, some private property, lots of SITLA property that is open for hunting, anywhere along the Red Creek is good for moose.\n<br>\n<i>Strawberry River</i>- The entire river corridor East of Strawberry Reservoir. Area is thick and can be difficult to spot moose. Primarily land managed by the UDWR\n<br>\n    \n<u>Recommended areas Avintaquin Subunit:</u>\n<br>\n<i>Reservation Ridge</i>- Big area, road on the divide, great area for glassing, not as many moose as Currant Creek.\n<br>\n<i>Strawberry Peak Area</i>- Highest peak on Avintaquin, great access to roadless areas(Slab Canyon and Cow Hollow), not a lot of moose in these areas.\n<br>\n<i>Long Ridge</i>- Great glassing area, areas South of Long Ridge along creeks and near ponds. Not a high density area.\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas Wasatch West Subunit:</u>\n<br>\n<i>American Fork Canyon</i>- The canyon road takes you from the mouth of AF canyon east to Heber City.  This area has a lot of moose.  Look around Casacade Springs area.\n<br>\n<i>Strawberry Reservoir</i>- Look along all streams feeding into Strawberry Reservoir, such as Strawberry River, Coop Creek, Mud Creek and Indian Creek and Trout Creek. These areas are not a high density area.\n<br>\n<i>Salt Lake County</i>- All canyons on the east side of the valley have moose in them, such as Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons, Mill Creek, and Lambs Canyon.  You can hunt with any weapon east on I-15 for OIAL hunts.  \n<br>\n<i>Other canyons to look in</i>- Squaw Peak road, Right Hand Fork of Hobble Creek, Diamond Fork, Sheep Creek and Tie Fork.  Not a lot of moose in these areas, but big bulls have been seen in the past. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Dollar Ridge Fire Update</b> – July 2018<br><br>\n\n\nIn early July 2018 the Dollar Ridge Fire burned approximately 50,000 acres on the Avintaquin and Currant Creek subunits of the Wasatch Mountains unit. The fire started in the Strawberry River Corridor and areas burned include portions of the Strawberry River wildlife management area and the Wildcat wildlife management area. Wildfire can have both negative and positive consequences for habitat and wildlife. In the right circumstances, wildfire can be a very effective tool for improving wildlife habitat. At lower elevation winter ranges fire may be detrimental if it removes important wintering feed sources or opens a niche for invasive weeds. In mid to high elevations fire often removes old, decadent growth and allows for new plants with high nutritional value. Grasses and forbs with high nutritional value are usually the first plant communities to come back after a fire. Regeneration in aspen stands is triggered by fire and mountain browse communities are quick to rebound.<br><br>\n\n \nThis fire mostly occurred in higher summer and transition ranges for big game. Based on current burned locations, we anticipate the effects of the Dollar Ridge Fire to be mostly positive for deer, elk and moose. We have observed that GPS collared moose and elk in the burn temporarily moved to adjacent habitats while the fire was actively burning, then moved back almost immediately after the active fire subsided. If we receive our normal late-summer monsoon weather pattern it is very likely the burned areas will have a flush of new growth or “green-up” prior to the hunting season.<br><br>\n\n \nWildfire can change wildlife distribution. Removal of cover may make an area less desirable for wary animals. Conversely, a good fall green-up might actually pull animals out of adjacent areas into the newly burned areas. Don’t overlook burned areas when hunting as they can be good places to locate game.<br><br>\n\n\nIn 2017 the Brian Head fire burned 71,000 acres, nearly 25% of the Panguitch unit. At the end of the 2017 hunting season there were very few complaints from hunters and hunter success rates were normal to above normal. The Wasatch is a large unit and there are many locations with good hunting that were not affected by the Dollar Ridge Fire. We anticipate good opportunities for sportsmen this fall despite disturbance from the fire. In the long term we expect wildlife to reap many benefits from this fire.",

To facilitate public safety, certain segments of the road will be closed during various construction activities. When the road is open, delays up to 30 minutes can be expected. The construction schedule is subject to change. During road closures, no motorized vehicles will be permitted on the route. Adjacent Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) trail routes will continue to be open during road closures. Where a potential conflict between an OHV and construction equipment is possible, the OHV access will be restricted for public safety.
