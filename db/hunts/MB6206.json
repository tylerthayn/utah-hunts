			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The Deseret Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) takes up parts of Weber, Morgan and Rich counties, with Rich county having the most area. The higher points on the Deseret CWMU are along Horse Ridge (8500 feet).  On the west the Unit drops away to about 6400 feet in the south and 8000 feet in the north. On the eastside of Horse Ridge the Unit makes a less steep drop, dropping down to around 6400 feet in the north and 6800 feet in the south along the Utah - Wyoming state border.  The most common elevation is 6400 feet but ranges from 6000 feet to 8700 feet with an elevation difference of 2700 feet.  Fifty-two percent (52%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 6800 feet and 7800 feet an elevation difference of 1000 feet.<br><br>The Deseret Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is much larger than other CWMUs in Utah, therefore land cover is more diversified. About half (50%) of the land cover on the Deseret CWMU is Inter-Mountain Basins Montane Sagebrush Steppe (62). Towards the northeast and at lower elevation, there are large areas of Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Steppe (66). Thet higher elevations on the west of the Unit, mixed with Sagebrush Steppe are extensive areas of Rocky Mountain Aspen Forest and Woodland (22). At lower elevations towards the northeast are several patches of Agriculture (114) land. At minor extents are Southern Rocky Mountain Montane-Subalpine Grassland (71), Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland (48), and Rocky Mountain Gambel Oak-Mixed Montane shrubland (41).<br><br>One of the Deseret Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, WOODRUFF (429595), is about 10.5 km north from the north edge of the CWMU.  WOODRUFF has one hundred eleven (111) years of records, 1897 - 2008.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 2.64 inches, but it can be as high as 5.18 inches or as low as 0.64 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 15 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 8 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 1 day of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 8.7 inches but can be as high as 29.2 inches.  FALL temperature at WOODRUFF averages 40.8 degrees F. but can be as high as 111.0 degrees F. or as low as -26.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 73 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 6 days above 90 degrees F.",
