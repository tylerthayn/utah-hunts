			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Approximately 50% of this unit where pronghorn can be found is private property.  Hunters should obtain written permission to access private lands before entering.  \n<br>\n Three pronghorn CWMUs exist on the Snowville unit. No hunting is allowed on CWMUs without the appropriate permit.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Caution should be used when taking aim at pronghorn in this unit to ensure a safe backstop.  Long range shots are common when pursuing pronghorn and animals in this unit will be on or near agricultural fields.  Cell phone coverage is good in this area but not complete.  Ensure that someone else knows where you plan on camping and hunting, and when you will be returning.  Nearest services are in Tremonton or Snowville.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically between the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until the first week of December.  ",

Populations can be found west of Snowville, Wildcat Hill, Kelton, Baker Hills, Matlin Mtns, and west of the Locomotive Springs Road.  Once livestock near Snowville are moved to the irrigated crop fields in late fall, pronghorn will move south onto the rangelands for the winter.",
