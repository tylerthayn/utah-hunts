			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "It is such a large area that hunter competition is really low.  I would put a significant effort into pre-season scouting on this unit.  Don’t be afraid to ask the oil field workers where they have been seeing pronghorn.  They drive the roads that go right through prime antelope habitat every day and can be a great resource.  \n\nI would work on locating water sources, placing trail cameras, and selecting a site for a ground blind.  Unless it rains which has been a rare occurrence, antelope have to come to water.  It is an extremely fun hunt, and you can see antelope all throughout the day.  Spot and stalk techniques are effective as well.  The pronghorn are used to vehicle traffic because of all the oil and gas production in the area.  They rely on their eye sight and speed to avoid predation.  As long as they don’t see anything out of the ordinary they are fairly docile, and calm.    \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and hot conditions.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "72.7~425~385~~~2.0–3.0~3.7~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:  The Vernal antelope herd does not show many signs of migration.  Throughout the year they stay in the same general area.  During the rut the larger herds tend to break up into smaller herds with one to two bucks in the herd.  The great thing about hunting antelope is that you can hunt them all throughout the day.  \n\nVegetative communities that dominate the areas of the herd unit frequented by pronghorn include salt desert shrub types on the lower elevation zones grading upward in elevation to Wyoming sage habitats.  Annual precipitation generally varies from 6 to 8 inches in these vegetation types.  Forb production is important for healthy fawn survival.  Water distribution can be limiting but has been provided by the BLM and other conservation interests through guzzlers or other devices.  During the past decade of drought, the poor maintenance condition of many of these artificial water sources limited their effectiveness.  Repairs have been made and are continuing.  \n\nNatural gas and oil production is rapidly increasing on pronghorn range with subsequent vegetative removal limiting both forage availability and habitat effectiveness.  Habitat loss and disturbance associated with drilling and other energy extraction activities may be a significant factor affecting pronghorn populations.  I have seen antelope shade up during the day under the large tanks on oil well pads.  \n\nI would focus on rangeland that boarder’s private agricultural land.  During late summer agricultural fields are essential for large herds of antelope.  The Ashlee Oil Field holds large groups of antelope.  Hwy 88 near the Hwy 40 intersection is a great place to look.  North of the Green River there are large salt desert shrub communities.\n\nScouting Tips:\nA good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate springs and guzzlers in the more arid areas on the northern part of the unit.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same vicinity.   \n\nBehavior:  Antelope are fairly solitary, and herd up in small groups during the rut.  Bucks like to make scrapes in the dirt roads to make territories and warn off other competing bucks.  I don’t see large herds of antelope on this unit.  A large group of antelope in the Book Cliffs is 12-18 head.  They have to stay relatively close to a sustainable water source.  If it rains they are less likely to visit springs or guzzlers and more likely to drink out of hoof prints or natural water catches.  \n   \n",
