			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Book Cliffs antelope population has been steadily declining since 1998.  It could be from a combination of drought, predation, and interspecific competition.  It is a still a good place to draw a permit.  It is such a large area that hunter competition is really low.  I would put a significant effort into pre-season scouting on this unit.  Don’t be afraid to ask the oil field workers where they have been seeing pronghorn.  They drive the roads that go right through prime antelope habitat every day and can be a great resource.  \n\nI would work on locating water sources.  Unless it rains which has been a rare occurrence, antelope have to come to water.  It is an extremely fun hunt, and you can see antelope all throughout the day.  \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nThe Book Cliffs mountain range is one of the more remote areas in Utah.  There are no service stations for many miles.  Plan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n\nThe Book Cliffs has a high bear population. Keep a clean camp and put your garbage in a place that is inaccessible to bears.  If you do have problems with bears please report them to the DWR Northeastern Regional Office as soon as possible (435 781-9453), or call the local dispatch center (435 789-4222).    \n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:  The majority of hunters choose to hunt close to the Seep Ridge Road on the north end of the unit.  After the road crosses the White River you are on the unit.  Once you cross the river and are off of Tribal land I would start focusing your efforts there.  There are several wide open flats with folding hills that antelope prefer.   The Glen Bench Road is the first major road that takes you back to the east.  I wouldn’t be deterred from all of the oil field traffic.  The oil field workers spend a lot of time driving through prime antelope habitat, and can provide some great scouting tips.  \n\nOn the west side of the unit there is a large open area called Wild Horse Bench.  It is a popular place for antelope, elk, wild horses, livestock, and some deer.  I have seen antelope in this area, but it is a large area and sometimes they are difficult to locate.  I don’t think it receives very much hunting pressure.  \n\nWinter Ridge is an area with sparse antelope, but receives very little hunting pressure.  \n\nMigration Patterns:  The Book Cliffs antelope herd does not show many signs of migration.  Throughout the year they stay in the same general area.  During the rut the larger herds tend to break up into smaller herds with one to two bucks in the herd.  The great thing about hunting antelope is that you can hunt them all throughout the day.  \n\nVegetative communities that dominate the areas of the herd unit frequented by pronghorn include salt desert shrub types on the lower elevation zones grading upward in elevation to Wyoming sage habitats.  Annual precipitation generally varies from 6 to 8 inches in these vegetation types.  Forb production is important for healthy fawn survival.  Water distribution can be limiting but has been provided by the BLM and other conservation interests through guzzlers or other devices.  During the past decade of drought, the poor maintenance condition of many of these artificial water sources limited their effectiveness.  Repairs have been made and are continuing.  \n\nNatural gas and oil production is rapidly increasing on pronghorn range with subsequent vegetative removal limiting both forage availability and habitat effectiveness.  Habitat loss and disturbance associated with drilling and other energy extraction activities may be a significant factor affecting pronghorn populations.  I have seen antelope shade up during the day under the large tanks on oil well pads.  \n\nScouting Tips:\nA good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate springs and guzzlers in the more arid areas on the northern part of the unit.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same vicinity.   \n\nBehavior:  Antelope are fairly solitary, and herd up in small groups during the rut.  Bucks like to make scrapes in the dirt roads to make territories and warn off other competing bucks.  I don’t see large herds of antelope on this unit.  A large group of antelope in the Book Cliffs is 12-18 head.  They have to stay relatively close to a sustainable water source.  If it rains they are less likely to visit springs or guzzlers and more likely to drink out of hoof prints or natural water catches.  \n",
