			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The pronghorn population on the Kaiparowits exists on the East Clark Bench area near Big Water, UT.  This population is limited to the north and east by the cliffs on the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. There is a large tract of SITLA lands on the south side of US89 where the population may extend slightly into Arizona.  Eastern movements are limited by the Cockscomb but some pronghorn may move west beyond the Paria River onto the Paunsaugunt unit.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nOverall, this desert population is composed of 50-70 individuals that are usually found in low densities.  Arid conditions may cause small groups to form around man-made water sources.  Recruitment is generally limited by summer precipitation conditions.    \n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Kaiparowits unit offers substantial truck and ATV access which is highly dependent on weather.  Much of this area is inaccessible during wet conditions.  A 4WD vehicle is highly recommended.  Cellular phone coverage is spotty but many pronghorn areas offer some coverage.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\nPlan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and hot conditions.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "100~650~25~~~2.0â€“3.0~5~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>  The majority of hunters choose to hunt near Cottonwood Creek east to Wahweap Creek on the north side of US89.  Pronghorn densities are lower on the south side of US89 but typically they can be found closer to the AZ border.  Be prepared with a GPS to know where the stateline exists.  This area is composed mostly of public lands but pronghorn may be found on private lands near Church Wells, UT.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\nA good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate springs and guzzlers in the more arid areas of the unit.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same vicinity.   \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>  Antelope are fairly solitary, and herd up in small groups during the rut.  Bucks like to make scrapes in the dirt roads to make territories and warn off other competing bucks.  They have to stay relatively close to a sustainable water source.  If it rains they are less likely to visit springs or guzzlers and more likely to drink out of ephemeral pools or natural water catches.  \n   \n",
