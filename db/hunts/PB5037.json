			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Scouting Tips:  Pronghorn are a fairly easy animal to locate.  For archery hunts scouting is important, there are many guzzlers spread out across the entire unit, these guzzlers can be an excellent place to set up blinds. Areas where there are pronghorn will more than likely have a guzzler or some water sources nearby. Trail cameras have become very popular over the last several years and they can be a great way to see what type of bucks are coming into water sources.\nBehavior: As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find pronghorn, but pronghorn can still be fairly easy to find throughout the whole day.  \n\nPronghorn rut: There will typically be rutting activity starting in August, with the peak of the rut being in September. They will be rutting during the any weapon hunt.\n\nRecommended areas Anthro Unit from West to East:\n\nAnthro Mountain Areas- There are a few groups of pronghorn that live in the higher elevations in the summer and early fall. There are fewer animals in these areas, but it can be a pretty place to hunt. Some areas to try are the following: Wire Fence Ridge, Nutter’s Ridge, Jeep Trail, Alkaline Ridge(Best), and Choke Cherry(Good).\n\nWells Draw- Starting just South of Pleasant Valley on BLM property. Lots of pronghorn in this area, there are many roads and well pads.\n\nSand Wash Road- Anywhere along this road and all side roads can hold pronghorn\n\nLittle Desert- There aren’t a lot of pronghorn in this area, there are several guzzlers that should have pronghorn near them.\n\nEight Mile Flat- lots of oil field activity, great area to glass.\n\n",
