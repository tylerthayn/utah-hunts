			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "In an effort to boost population numbers of this herd, 74 pronghorn were transplanted to the Hatch Point area from the Parker Plateau in 2014.  You will more than likely see pronghorn with red collars or ear tags.  These markers allow biologists to calculate a sightability index when conducting surveys.  This index will help in fine-tuning population estimates.  If you should harvest a pronghorn with one of these markers, please notify the Division of Wildlife Resources Southeast Region at 435-613-3700.  With a very limited number of permits on the unit, hunter competition is low.  I would put effort into pre-season scouting on this unit.  Don’t be afraid to ask the oil field workers or ranchers where they have been seeing pronghorn.  They drive the roads that go right through prime antelope habitat every day and can be a great resource.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nI would work on locating water sources, placing trail cameras, and selecting areas with good vantage points for glassing.  Unless it rains, antelope have to come to water.  It is an extremely fun hunt, and you can see antelope all throughout the day.  Spot and stalk techniques are effective.  Antelope rely on their eye sight and speed to avoid predation.  As long as they don’t see anything out of the ordinary they are fairly docile and calm, so be stealthy.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp/hunt and when you will return.  Flash floods can and do occur during inclement weather, watch the sky and plan accordingly.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and hot conditions.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "66.7~300~131~~~2.0–3.0~4.8~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>  The Hatch Point antelope herd does not show many signs of migration.  Throughout the year they stay in the same general area.  During the rut the larger herds tend to break up into smaller herds with one to two bucks in the herd.  The great thing about hunting antelope is that you can hunt them all throughout the day.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nVegetative communities that dominate the areas of the herd unit frequented by pronghorn include salt desert shrub types on the lower elevation zones grading upward in elevation to Wyoming sage habitats.  Annual precipitation generally varies from 6 to 8 inches in these vegetation types.  Forb production is important for healthy fawn survival.  Water distribution can be limiting but has been provided by the BLM and other conservation interests through guzzlers or other devices.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\nI would focus on rises that overlook rangelands below.  During late summer bucks will be joining small herds of does, preparing for the rut.  Glassing these large areas can be very productive.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\nA good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective right before the hunt opens.  I would plan on covering a lot of ground to locate springs and guzzlers.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same vicinity.   \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior: </u> Antelope are fairly solitary, and herd up in small groups during the rut.  Bucks like to make scrapes in the dirt roads to make territories and warn off other competing bucks.  I don’t see large herds of antelope on this unit.  A large group of antelope on the Hatch Point unit is 8 - 12 head.  Antelope are active throughout the day, but like most wildlife species, they are increasingly active just before sunrise and sunset.  They have to stay relatively close to a sustainable water source.  If it rains they are less likely to visit springs or guzzlers and more likely to drink out of hoof prints or natural water catches.  \n",
