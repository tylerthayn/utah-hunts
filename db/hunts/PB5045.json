			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The San Rafael Desert pronghorn unit is large combining the South San Rafael and the Henry Mountain units. These units are combined because of small herd sizes distributed over large areas. Drought has impacted population numbers and herd distribution on this unit the past few years, especially east and west of SR24 between I-70 and Hanksville where most hunting has taken place in the past, so plan to expand your hunt area on the unit. There are numerous roads traversing the area allowing access to see a lot of country to find them. The popualtion is estimated at 250 animals and it will take covering a lot of country to find them. You can find antelope throughout the day but like other wildlife they are more active in the morning and evening.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Use common sense. Let others know where you will be hunting, camped, etc. Some have been stranded by flat tires, very muddy conditions, flash floods, etc.  Carry a survival kit. Some areas have cell phone coverage but not all. Consider hand held radios and a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety. ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>The following is not a comprehensive list of areas where you can find pronghorn on this unit. Pronghorn can still be found on both sides of SR24 between the San Rafael River and Fremont/Dirty Devil Rivers and between Goblin Valley, North Pinto Hills, and Factory bench, but it is becoming more difficult to find them.  A small number of pronghorn also reside between the San Rafael river and the town of Green River. Also on the west side of the unit south of I-70 to the Last Chance Desert, Mussentuchit Flat, and Rock Springs Bench. And Sinbad areas on the top of the San Rafael Swell off exit 131 on I-70 from Mckay Flat to Jerry's Flat. Areas on the Henry Mountains portion of the unit include the South Pinto Hills, Blue Valley Benches, and the southern portion of the Henry's unit south of Cow Flat, Coal Bed Mesa, Clay Point, Bull Frog Creek, and Eggnog area. Pronghorn seen on the Burr Desert have been few.<br>\n<br>\n\nVegetative communities that dominate the areas of the herd unit frequented by pronghorn include salt desert shrub types and into the pinion-juniper zone around the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mountain.  Annual precipitation in this area generally varies from 6 to 12 inches in these vegetation types.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> Binoculars and a good spotting scope are essential companions when hunting.  Spend time prior to the hunt getting to know where the pronghorn are. along with your pre-season scouting its natural and good to intensify the effort leading up to the hunt opening. Pronghorn are most active in the mornings and evenings but can be hunted all day. There are numerous roads on this unit that allow you to see a lot of country. Locating water sources like springs and livestock ponds, setting up blinds or spot and stalk are good hunting strategies; look for tracks and scratch marks where they are marking territories especially on the dirt roads.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same area if water is available unless he is run off or water is scarce.  Look for vantage points where you can glass at rangelands below. Bucks are differentiated from does by larger horns and a black cheek patch. They are very curious and sometimes will come closer to you if they cannot figure out what you are.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>  San Rafael herds do not migrate long distances, they stay in a general area throughout the year. During the rut larger herds tend to break up into smaller herds with one to two bucks in the herd depending on food resources. There can be as many as 12-18 in a herd in late summer and fall. As the rut nears mature bucks will separate from one another and look for does. Keep a look out because other bucks may be around the area when a buck is herded up with his does. Later after the rut other bucks join in with some of these smaller herds, which then join together with other herds to make larger wintering herds. There always seems to be solitary bucks and smaller buck herds around throughout all the seasons of the year. Bucks like to make scrapes on dirt roads defending their territory and warn off other competing bucks. They are very fast, and except for fawns they can outrun all their natural predators; their eyes are situated to allow about 300-degrees of visibility, and they can see and detect movement 4 miles away.",
