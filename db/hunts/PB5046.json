			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Pronghorn are below objective on this unit due to drought but there are numerous roads traversing the area that allow you to see a lot of country to find them. There is opportunity to find antelope throughout the day but like other wildlife they are more active in the morning and evening. There are also many opportunities around cultivated agricultural areas to harvest.  This is a great place to hunt having local communities nearby.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Use common sense. Let others know where you will be hunting, camped, etc. Some have been stranded by flat tires, very muddy conditions, flash floods, etc.  Carry a survival kit. Most areas have fair cell phone coverage but not all. Consider hand held radios and a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Be prepared for inclement weather, it can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Keep abreast of the weather forecast. Expect and prepare for unfavorable weather conditions such as high temperatures, intense thunder storms, lightning, flash floods, and muddy roads that are difficult to travel even with chains.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u>  Rangeland that borders private agricultural land are good places to hunt especially around the agricultural communities of Wellington, Elmo, and Cleveland. Other hunting areas include, Furniture Draw, Mounds, The Red Ledges area, and south and west of SR6 to Woodside. There are fewer pronghorn to the west of SR6 between Woodside and I-70.<br>\n<br>\n\nVegetative communities that dominate the areas of the herd unit frequented by pronghorn include salt desert shrub types and into the pinion-juniper zone around the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mountain.  Annual precipitation in this area generally varies from 6 to 12 inches in these vegetation types.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> Binoculars and a good spotting scope are essential companions when hunting.  Spend time prior to the hunt getting to know where the pronghorn are. Intensify the scouting efforts leading up to the hunt opening. Pronghorn are most active in the mornings and evenings but can be hunted all day. There are numerous roads on this unit that allow you to see a lot of country. Locating water sources like springs and livestock ponds, setting up blinds or spot and stalk are good hunting strategies; look for tracks and scratch marks where they are marking territories especially on the dirt roads.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same area if water is available unless he is run off or water is scarce.  Look for vantage points where you can glass at rangelands below. Bucks are differentiated from does by larger horns and a black cheek patch. They are very curious and sometimes will come closer to you if they cannot figure out what you are.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>  San Rafael herds do not migrate long distances, they stay in a general area throughout the year. During the rut larger herds tend to break up into smaller herds with one to two bucks in the herd depending on food resources. There can be as many as 12-18 in a herd in late summer and fall. As the rut nears mature bucks will separate from one another and look for does. Keep a look out because other bucks may be around the area when a buck is herded up with his does. Later after the rut other bucks join in with some of these smaller herds, which then join together with other herds to make larger wintering herds. There always seems to be solitary bucks and smaller buck herds around throughout all the seasons of the year. Bucks like to make scrapes on dirt roads defending their territory and warn off other competing bucks. To avoid predation antelope eyes are situated on the head to allow about 300-degrees of visibility, and they can see and detect movement 4 miles away.  Except for young fawns, they can out-run all their natural predators.\n",
