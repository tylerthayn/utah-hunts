			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Pronghorn rut:</u><br>\nThe pronghorn rut usually starts the end of September so it does not really affect the hunt.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nPronghorn are fairly habitual and can be found in the same general area from late summer through the hunt.  Pronghorn are best scouted from a distance using a spotting scope or binoculars so they don’t leave the area.  They are most active in the morning and evening when the temperatures are cooler.  This area has been heavily impacted by energy development.  There are a lot of roads from the energy development so hunters should have no problem finding pronghorn.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of the day.  Most of the time they are in desert scrub/sagebrush flat areas.  If the weather is extremely hot, they will often seek shade during the middle part of the day.  Pronghorn are herd animals.  You will often see groups of does and fawns with only a few bucks mixed in during the fall.  During the rut, bucks will separate from other males to find does to mate with.  The rest of the year, the bucks are usually with other pronghorn.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Buck vs Doe:</u><br>\nHunters can tell bucks from does by several characteristics.  Bucks will have larger horns and a black cheek patch.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find pronghorn:</u><br>\n90% of the pronghorn are found on public lands in desert scrub and sagebrush flat areas.  They typically stay out of heavily treed and cliffy areas.  Pronghorn are found near water sources.  Pronghorn are not typically found on Diamond Mountain.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the Bonanza/Diamond Mtn:</u><br>\nGood areas to hunt include Deadman Bench, Coyote Basin, Glen Bench, and Snake John.  Diamond Mountain subunit is not recommended due to either no or very few pronghorn.\n",
