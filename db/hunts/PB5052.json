			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is primarily characterized by wide desert valleys separated by steep mountain ranges. The valleys are desert shrub and salt flats, with greasewood. The valleys transition into grassy foothills, made up primarily of cheatgrass. The higher benches have bunchgrass and sagebrush. The mid elevations are juniper woodlands. The tallest elevations have junipers and pinyon pines, with pockets of conifers and aspens. This unit primarily consists of the following mountain ranges - Deep Creek, Fishsprings, Dugway/Thomas, Confusions/Conger. Most pronghorn will found in the narrow bench of these mountain ranges and the valleys, often within two miles of a water source.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" or “In-reach” type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return. It is a good idea to have lots of drinking water, two spare tires and extra fuel with you.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Thunderstorms can cause muddy road conditions and rare flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with keeping their harvest meat cool.  Expect hot weather and plan accordingly.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This unit has many pronghorn; however, they are in low densities. A hunter needs to plan to cover many miles to locate groups of pronghorn. During the hunts, bucks will be with groups of does. Most hunters harvest a mature buck with 13” horns. A few bucks will be in the 14 and 15” tall range. A hunter will have to look over many bucks to find one over 13”. Plan to cover most of the unit in search of pronghorn, focusing on the grassy benches.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips: </u> Pronghorn are a fairly easy animal to locate.  For archery hunts scouting is important, there are many guzzlers spread out across the entire unit, these guzzlers can be an excellent place to set up blinds. Areas where there are pronghorn will more than likely have a guzzler or some water sources nearby. Trail cameras have become very popular over the last several years and they can be a great way to see what type of bucks are coming into water sources.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u> As with most big game animals the early mornings and evenings are the best times to find pronghorn, but pronghorn can still be fairly easy to find throughout the whole day.  \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Pronghorn rut:</u> There will typically be rutting activity starting in August, with the peak of the rut being in September. They will be rutting during the any weapon hunt.",
