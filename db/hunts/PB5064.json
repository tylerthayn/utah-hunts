Many pronghorn are now found in timbered areas where they traditionally would not be. The objective of this hunt is to move hunting pressure to the pronghorn in these timbered areas while allowing population growth of pronghorn in their core areas of habitat. <br>\n<br>\nThis will be a challenging hunt. The pronghorn are very wary of motorized vehicles and will often move to cover before they are in view. Leaving vehicles to hike and glass is recommended. Although there are many sources of water, hunting water sources can be an effective strategy. Hunters need to be very aware of the hunt boundaries as pronghorn will move between areas within this hunt boundary to areas not included.<br>\n<br>\nGroups of pronghorn have been seen north of Highway 24 near Fish Lake, Logging Grove, Big Lake, Coyote Hollow, and Pollywog Lake. Any meadows or openings in these areas are likely places to find pronghorn.  ",
