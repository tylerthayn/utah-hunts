			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Pronghorn on this unit love timbered areas! During the warmer weather they will lounge in small meadows in the aspen and spruce forests on the south and east portions of the Parker. As hunting pressure increases on this unit the pronghorn will also use the trees for security cover. Access to these areas in a vehicle is limited. The pronghorn on the Parker are also wary of motorized vehicles and will go to great lengths to avoid them. It may be profitable for hunters to plan on walking away from roads and vehicles to glass for animals. There are many water sources on the Parker and pronghorn like to use these sources. They are accustomed to drinking every day and locating water sources and waiting in blinds for animals to show up is a good hunting strategy. Quite often during this hunt monsoon rainstorms are moving across the Parker almost every afternoon. These storms fill every tire track and puddle with water and pronghorn readily use these sources of water also.",
