Mountain Spring Wash the only substantial drainage cuts the unit also ranges from 5100 feet to 5300 feet.   The most common levation is 5200 feet but ranges from 5100 feet to 5400 feet with an elevation difference of 300 feet.  Fifty-six percent (56%) of the CWMU elevation ranges between 5200 feet and 5300 feet an elevation difference of 100 feet.<br><br> Much of the Zane Cooperative Wildlife Management Unit (CWMU) is dominated by Inter-Mountain Basins Big Sagebrush Shrubland (48). Most of this Sagebrush shrubland is in the northwest part. Inter-Mountain Basins Mixed Salt Desert Scrub (58) is dominate in the southwest part, extending into the southeast. Patches of Inter-Mountain Basins Semi-Desert Shrub Steppe (67) occur across the unit, but there are large areas on the eastside of the Unit.  In the middle of the Unit, are patches of Inter-Mountain Basins Semi-Desert Grassland (76).\n<br><br>One of the Zane Cooperative Wildlife Mangement Unit (CWMU) nearest weather stations, LUND (425247), is about 7.8 km northeast from the northeast edge of the CWMU.  LUND has sixty-seven (67) years of records, 1900 - 1967.  During the FALL (September, October and November) the average precipitation is 1.97 inches, but it can be as high as 4.37 inches or as low as 0.03 inch.  During the 91-day FALL period, 7 days will experience greater than or equal to 0.01 inch of precipitation, 5 days of greater than or equal to 0.10 inch, or 1 day of the greater than or equal to 0.50 inch of precipitation.  Snowfall during the FALL averages 1.1 inches but can be as high as 7.0 inches.  FALL temperature at LUND averages 50.3 degrees F. but can be as high as 104.0 degrees F. or as low as -9.0 degrees F.  During the FALL, 47 days will be below freezing (32 degrees F.) and 5 days above 90 degrees F.",
