Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.  Services are located in Tremonton, Snowville, and Grouse Creek.  Specific rules to maintain safe conditions while on the CWMU are part of the management plan.  Hunters should contact the CWMU operator prior to applying for the unit.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of December.  ",
