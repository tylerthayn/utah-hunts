			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Hunt is located in both the Mt Dutton and Paunsaugunt Units. Good numbers of pronghorn can be see with great bucks available. This hunt runs during the rut so bucks are often very active throughout the day. Mornings and evenings are generally best, but because of the need for water and the rut pronghorn can be found all day long. If it is a dry summer and fall pronghorn could be congregated around the water. <br>\nMost hunters often harvest early in the hunt often the first morning. So generally by the second day you could literally have the entire unit to yourself. Cover some country and if you find a great buck they generally don't move very far if they have does with them.",
