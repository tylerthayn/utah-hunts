			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt is set up to address increasing numbers of pronghorn that are using agricultural properties and causing damage. There are numerous roads traversing the area that will allow you to find them if you take the time. Get to know landowners prior to applying for the permit if possible and be sure to get written permission from landowners prior to hunting on private property. Know the boundary and only hunt within it. Especially take care to know what is behind your target. There are many homes, barns and out buildings, equipment, sprinklers, livestock, etc. that you will need to be aware of. Please be careful! It is highly encouraged that you get familiar with the area and properties that antelope are using prior to applying for the permit.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Use common sense. Let others know where you will be hunting, camped, etc. Some have been stranded by flat tires, very muddy conditions, flash floods, etc.  Carry a survival kit. Many areas have fair cell phone coverage but not all. Consider hand held radios and a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Be prepared for inclement weather, it can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Keep abreast of the weather forecast. Expect and prepare for unfavorable weather conditions such as high temperatures, intense thunder storms, lightning, flash floods, and muddy roads that are difficult to travel even with chains.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u><b>Location of harvest:</b></u>  Rangeland that borders private agricultural land between the communities of Wellington, Elmo, and Cleveland are starting places to hunt, but obtaining permission to hunt private property prior to the opening of the hunt will increase your chances to harvest on this unit.<br>\n<br>\n\nVegetative communities that dominate the areas of the herd unit frequented by pronghorn include salt desert shrub types, irrigated pasture and hay fields.  Annual precipitation in this area generally varies from 6 to 9 inches in these vegetation types.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u><b>Scouting Tips:</b></u> Binoculars and a good spotting scope are essential companions when hunting.  Spend time prior to the hunt getting to know where the pronghorn are. Intensify the scouting efforts leading up to the hunt opening. Pronghorn are most active in the mornings and evenings but can be hunted all day. There are numerous roads on this unit that allow you to see a lot of country. Locating water sources like springs and livestock ponds, setting up blinds or spot and stalk are good hunting strategies; look for tracks and scratch marks where they are marking territories especially on the dirt roads.  Trail cameras can make a big difference in scouting these areas.  Once you locate a buck there is a good chance he will stay in same area if water is available unless he is run off or water is scarce.  Look for vantage points where you can glass at rangelands below. Bucks are differentiated from does by larger horns and a black cheek patch. They are very curious and sometimes will come closer to you if they cannot figure out what you are.<br>\n<br>\n\n<u><b>Behavior:</b></u>  San Rafael herds do not migrate long distances, they stay in a general area throughout the year. During the rut larger herds tend to break up into smaller herds with one to two bucks in the herd depending on food resources. There can be as many as 12-18 in a herd in late summer and fall. As the rut nears mature bucks will separate from one another and look for does. Keep a look out, other bucks may be around the area when a buck is herded up with his does. Later after the rut other bucks join in with some of these smaller herds, which then join together with other herds to make larger wintering herds. There always seems to be solitary bucks and smaller buck herds around throughout all the seasons of the year. Bucks like to make scrapes on dirt roads defending their territory and warn off other competing bucks. They are very fast, and except for fawns they can outrun all their natural predators; their eyes are situated to allow about 300-degrees of visibility, and they can see and detect movement 4 miles away.",
