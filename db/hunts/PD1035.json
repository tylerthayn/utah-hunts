Written permission needs to be obtained before hunting on private land.  There are a few groups of pronghorn north of highway 50, though the majority of animals will be found south of highway 50. There is a pronghorn CWMU on the southern part of the unit that cannot be hunted on with this permit. There are areas with higher concentrations of pronghorn, however, pronghorn can be found scattered throughout the unit. Areas around agricultural fields can be productive areas to hunt. A good map will be needed to be respectful of private property (though some landowners may allow access to their property with permission).",
