			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt unit encompasses low elevation desert and higher mountainous sagebrush terrain, with the pronghorn distributed throughout the unit.  Road access is good throughout the unit, with one area-Bare Top-closed to motorized vehicles.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically between the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nPronghorn are fairly habitual and can be found in the same general area from late summer through the hunt.  Pronghorn are best scouted from a distance using a spotting scope or binoculars so they donâ€™t leave the area.  They are most active in the morning and evening when the temperatures are cooler; these are the best times to scout.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of the day.  Most of the time they are in desert scrub/sagebrush flat areas.  If the weather is extremely hot, they will often seek shade during the middle part of the day.  Pronghorn are herd animals.  You will often see groups of does and fawns with only a few bucks mixed in during the fall.  During the rut, bucks will separate from other males to find does to mate with.  The rest of the year, the bucks are usually with other pronghorn.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Buck vs Doe:</u><br>\nHunters can tell bucks from does by several characteristics.  Bucks will have larger horns and a black cheek patch.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Pronghorn rut:</u><br>\nThe pronghorn rut usually starts the end of September. <br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find pronghorn:</u><br>\nPronghorn are scattered throughout the appropriate habitat on this unit.  They can be found in agricultural fields and in desert scrub or mountainous sage brush areas.  They typically stay out of heavily treed and cliffy areas.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the West Daggett:</u><br>\nGood areas to hunt include Lucerne Valley, Death Valley, Phil Pico, Conner Basin, and private property (if you have written permission).\n",
