There are only a few roads that go on or near bighorn sheep habitat on the unit.  The Hastings Road just east of the Green River in the town of Green River will take you along the east side of the Green River for about 15 miles until the road dead-ends near Rattlesnake Canyon.  This road will provide the closest access to where most of the sheep live.  This road is graded by the county and is generally in good shape.  There are some tight spots along the river that you should be wary of if there is snowy or icy conditions.  The Tushar Canyon road will go northeast off of the Hastings Road about 9 miles north of the town of Green River.  It will access the right and left fork of Tushar Canyon and loop around along the bench to the east and provide access to Coal, Horse, and Floy Canyons.  The Coal Canyon Road is the first right hand turn off of the Hastings Road while still in the town of Green River.  It will go through a bunch of alfalfa fields and then up on the cliffs.  the Horse Canyon and Floy Canyon roads can be access by following the frontage road along I-70 to the east.  Despite all of these directions, most of your time will be spent on foot.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Deer:</b>  The main areas with the highest concentrations of deer include Nash Wash (Exit 204 off of Interstate 70), Cottonwood Canyon (Exit 214), Hay Canyon (Exit 221), and Bitter Creek (Exit 227)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Pronghorn:</b>  Use any exit off of Interstate 70 or drive the frontage road along the Interstate.

This is good bighorn sheep habitat and bighorns have been seen on both sides of the boundary near the mouth of Coal Creek.  Take great care not to hunt or trespass on these tribal lands.  The upper Tribal Boundary at upper elevations near Sego Canyon generally doesn't  have bighorn sheep during November.  There are small isolated pieces of private property in the mouths of Coal, Horse, Floy, and Thompson Canyons.  County roads go through these properties so it is best to simply travel through them and park on public lands if you do not have written permission to hunt on these private lands.  Bighorn sheep generally do not spend a great deal of time on these private lands. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Pronghorn:</b>  There is a large block of private land on the alfalfa fields near the town of Green River.  Antelope use this area.  Please secure written permission prior to hunting these private lands.  The remainder of the private lands on this unit either do not occur in Pronghorn habitat or are scattered and unmarked.  <br>\n<br>\n<b>Deer:</b>  Deer concentrate on private lands at the mouths of Cottonwood, Hay, and Bitter Creek Canyons.
