			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is also known as the Rattlesnake Unit.  Bighorn sheep populations have been stable in this area for several decades.  Permit numbers have not changed dramatically over this time period.  The unit boundary is relatively large however, the vast majority of the occupied bighorn sheep habitat is in the western third of the unit from Thompson west to Green River.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This unit is steep and rough with very little cell coverage.  As in most bighorn sheep habitat, hunters should be in excellent physical condition prior to the hunt as most hunters end up walking dozens of miles and climbing thousands of feet prior to harvesting their ram.  As with most bighorn sheep habitat, there is an abundance of cliffs.  Be very careful scaling cliffs.  It is advised that you bring extra rope to assist with getting through difficult ledges.   A GPS unit is very handy on this unit to not only mark sheep and routes but also places where you can get through the ledges as they are relatively rare.  Hunters can sometimes spend hours hiking along trying to find a way through the ledges and wasting time and energy.  Bring plenty of water.  It can be warm in November and there is very little water on the unit.  Water in the Green River is plentiful but is tough on most portable water filters as it generally runs pretty muddy.    A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Weather conditions in November are variable on this unit.  Generally, plan on cold nights with mild days with little snow accumulation.  Most of the occupied bighorn sheep habitat occurs at lower elevations between 4200 and 6000 feet where snow generally doesn't accumulate.  Snow and bad weather is always possible in November.  The roads can get icy as they rarely see sunlight in these dark canyons.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest:\nOver 80% of the bighorn sheep observed on this unit are found within 2 miles of the Green River.  Sheep use the first 2 to 3 cliff bands above the river and the grassy benches between them.  The core area where most sheep live can be found between Tushar Canyon north to Rattlesnake Canyon. Lower densities of bighorn sheep can be found north of Rattlesnake Canyon to the tribal boundary in Coal Creek.  Lower densities of bighorn can also be found east of Tushar Canyon along the Book Cliffs to as far east as Thompson.  Generally no bighorn sheep are found anywhere on the unit east of the town of Thompson.  \n\nScouting Tips:\nIt is good to do pre-season scouting to learn country.  However, it is very hot on this unit during the summer months so plan accordingly.  You will need a good pair of binoculars and a spotting scope.  This unit looks a lot more like desert bighorn sheep habitat than Rocky Mountain bighorn habitat.  It is dry and cliffy.  During the summer you will most likely see groups of ewes, lambs, and young rams.  Many of the larger harvestable rams will not move on to public lands and be available for harvest until the rut begins in late October.  Do not be alarmed if there are no big rams in the summer.  They will show up by November.  Hunting generally gets better the later you go.  The peak of the rut tends to be the week of Thanksgiving.  Find groups of ewes and lambs and often times a new ram will be with the ewe group each day as rams are moving alot in November between ewe groups.  \n\nA way to cover lots of ground is to hike up on top of a canyon and glass the other side while having someone else hike the other side of the canyon and look back across the canyon toward you.  \n\nBehavior:\nThe month of November is during the bighorn sheep rut.  Rams are moving from group to group looking for ewes.  Rams can also be observed butting heads.  It is advised to occasionally stop and listen for the sound of butting heads it can be a good tool for locating sheep that are otherwise difficult to see.  Sheep are generally active throughout the day in November but activity is highest in morning and evening.  Bighorn sheep will not be as tied to water in November as it is generally more available that time of year if it has snowed.  Bighorn will generally avoid the flat mesa top areas where there is any sort of tree cover.  They tend to be found on the steep open cliffs and are occasionally are feeding on the flat canyon bottoms or benches.\n\nRam vs Ewe:\nBoth rams and ewes have horns.  Ram horns are much larger than ewe horns and will form a curl.  Many young rams will have a pronounced curl.  The best way to recognize mature trophy class bighorn rams is to look for horn mass particularly out near the tip of the horn.  Younger rams that are 3 to 5 years old will have plenty of horn length but the horn tips are very thin.  Mature rams 6 years and older tend to have thicker horns out near the tips, and thicker bases.  Often times if you are close enough you can count horn rings on rams to get an approximate age.\n\nRocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep rut:\nThe bighorn rut runs during late October and extends through early December with the peak being around Thanksgiving.\n\nWhere to find Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep:\nRecommended areas:\nHighest density areas are Tushar Canyon, the Canyon above Swaseys Beach, the canyon above the Rock House, and Butler Canyon.  Hike up through the first cliff band and hunt the upper cliff layers within 2 miles of the river and you will generally see sheep in these canyons.\n",

There are only a few roads that go on or near bighorn sheep habitat on the unit.  The Hastings Road just east of the Green River in the town of Green River will take you along the east side of the Green River for about 15 miles until the road dead-ends near Rattlesnake Canyon.  This road will provide the closest access to where most of the sheep live.  This road is graded by the county and is generally in good shape.  There are some tight spots along the river that you should be wary of if there is snowy or icy conditions.  The Tushar Canyon road will go northeast off of the Hastings Road about 9 miles north of the town of Green River.  It will access the right and left fork of Tushar Canyon and loop around along the bench to the east and provide access to Coal, Horse, and Floy Canyons.  The Coal Canyon Road is the first right hand turn off of the Hastings Road while still in the town of Green River.  It will go through a bunch of alfalfa fields and then up on the cliffs.  the Horse Canyon and Floy Canyon roads can be access by following the frontage road along I-70 to the east.  Despite all of these directions, most of your time will be spent on foot.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Deer:</b>  The main areas with the highest concentrations of deer include Nash Wash (Exit 204 off of Interstate 70), Cottonwood Canyon (Exit 214), Hay Canyon (Exit 221), and Bitter Creek (Exit 227)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Pronghorn:</b>  Use any exit off of Interstate 70 or drive the frontage road along the Interstate.

The upper Tribal Boundary at upper elevations near Sego Canyon generally doesn't  have bighorn sheep during November.  There are small isolated pieces of private property in the mouths of Coal, Horse, Floy, and Thompson Canyons.  County roads go through these properties so it is best to simply travel through them and park on public lands if you do not have written permission to hunt on these private lands.  Bighorn sheep generally do not spend a great deal of time on these private lands. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Pronghorn:</b>  There is a large block of private land on the alfalfa fields near the town of Green River.  Antelope use this area.  Please secure written permission prior to hunting these private lands.  The remainder of the private lands on this unit either do not occur in Pronghorn habitat or are scattered and unmarked.  <br>\n<br>\n<b>Deer:</b>  Deer concentrate on private lands at the mouths of Cottonwood, Hay, and Bitter Creek Canyons.
