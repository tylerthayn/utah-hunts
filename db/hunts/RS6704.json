			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage  on this hunt unit is spotty.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and hunt, and when you will return.  Roads around the mountain can become very slick and muddy when wet, and access roads are rough and can cause tire damage.  This unit is very isolated and is very far from the nearest services.  The closest services are in Wendover, Utah/Nevada, Grantsville, or Snowville.  Munitions from the active military base may be present on public property.  If found, do not touch!  Take a GPS location and report what you found.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, and wind.  Typically by this hunting season, any precipitation that is received is freezing rain or snow and temperatures regularly fall below freezing at night.  Be very cautious of lightning while scouting and hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Any precipitation will cause the roads to become very slick and muddy.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "The majority of sheep stay in the same general areas throughout much of the year.  During summer months, sheep concentrate on the north end of the mountain range in conjunction with natural water availability.  During the late fall and winter, sheep begin to spread south across the range.  Miners Basin and Desert Peak hold the highest densities of sheep, but sheep will range in high densities south to Big Pass and to the military boundary.  Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep are found in steep rocky terrain.  Choose your shot wisely.  Make sure it is in a safe place to harvest your bighorn sheep.  If you cannot safely retrieve the bighorn sheep, do not shoot.  Once the rut starts, the rams will be begin to move to where the ewes are.  Scouting is a good way to see what size of ram you can expect to harvest.  Sheep are most active in mornings and evenings.  Using a spotting scope works well to find sheep in the steep rocky areas.  Scores for sheep from the Newfoundlands have typically been in the 150s-160s.  We are going to start providing more opportunity in this hunt so those scores may be lower in the future.  ",
