			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit has spectacular scenery with many tourists, fishermen, and campers utilizing the area during the summer months.  Many visitors to this area travel here specifically to view bighorn sheep.  <br>\n<br>\nThis hunt allows hunters to scout and hunt from land or from a boat.  This unit is small with a low sheep population.  Many of the mature rams congregate in 1 to 2 groups most of the year.  <br>\n<br>\nHerd numbers have been declining and older rams have been dying before being harvested.  Hunters should expect a class III or 3/4 curl (score 140-150) type ram.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  It is quite common on clear mornings for clouds to build through the morning and have thunderstorms in the afternoon.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Location of harvest:</u><br>\nRocky Mountain bighorn sheep are found in steep rocky terrain.  Choose your shot wisely.  Make sure it is in a safe place to harvest your bighorn sheep.  If you cannot safely retrieve the bighorn sheep, do not shoot.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nThe bighorn sheep stay fairly consistently in the same general areas throughout much of the year.  Once the rut starts, the rams will be begin to move to where the ewes are.  Scouting is a good way to see what size of ram you can expect to harvest.  Scores for sheep on Bare Top are usually in the 140s-150s and are 5.5-6.5 years old.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Behavior:</u><br>\nLike other wildlife, they are most active in the early mornings and evenings, but they can be up and moving any time of day.  Most of the time they are in steep terrain, but they occasionally move down to the shoreline or up on top of Bare Top where itâ€™s flat.  Mature rams seem to hang out more in steeper cliffs than ewes.  Ewes with lambs prefer areas that are a little less steep and where they can find better feed.  Bighorn sheep will usually go to water at least once a day.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Ram vs Ewe:</u><br>\nBoth rams and ewes have horns.  Ram horns are much larger than ewe horns and will form a curl.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep rut:</u><br>\nThe bighorn rut runs during November.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Where to find Rocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep:</u><br>\nBighorn sheep like steep cliffy areas because it provides an escape from predators.  You can find them on grassy flats or near the shoreline when they are eating or come down to drink.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas:</u><br>\nThere are a couple of areas that the sheep use regularly.  These areas include Hideout, Boars Tusk, along the Flaming Gorge Reservoir shoreline and along the Green River below the dam to Little Hole.  Hunters that access the area by boat tend to have better success and satisfaction.\n",
