			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is very remote, very steep, insanely rugged country.  There is little to no cell coverage in most of the bighorn sheep habitat.  As in most bighorn sheep habitat, hunters should be in excellent physical condition prior to the hunt as most hunters end up walking dozens of miles and climbing thousands of feet prior to harvesting their ram.  As with most bighorn sheep habitat, there is an abundance of cliffs.  Be very careful scaling cliffs.  It is advised that you bring extra rope to assist with getting through difficult ledges.   A GPS unit is very handy on this unit to not only mark sheep and routes but also places where you can get through the ledges as they are relatively rare.  Hunters can sometimes spend hours hiking along trying to find a way through the ledges and wasting time and energy.  Bring plenty of water.  It can be warm in November and there is very little water on the unit.  Water in the Green River is plentiful but is tough on most portable water filters as it generally runs pretty muddy.    A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to travel to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "u>Location of harvest:</u>\nThe core area where most bighorn reside and are harvested is along the lower Price River and lower Green River in Gray Canyon.  Probably 75% of the harvest occurs here.  There are small concentrations of sheep near Lila Canyon where people can harvest sheep.  Sheep can be found down along the river and canyon bottoms all the way up through the cliffs to the top.  It is rare to find sheep on the juniper covered mesas on the top.  The confluence of the Price River and Green River tends to have the highest concentrations of sheep.  There are no known sheep north of Rabbit Valley along the Green River so I wouldn't spend much time there.  Bighorn observations in lower Range Creek are also quite rare. Common spots where sheep are found from south to north include Blue Castle Canyon, Long Canyon, Short Canyon, Sand Knolls Canyon, the lower Price River, and Jenny Canyon.  Sheep can also be found on Bighorn Mountain and along the face of the Book Cliffs facing SR-6 as far north as Sunnyside. \n<br>\n<br><img class=\"imageLayout\" alt=\"BH Sheep Locations During Surveys 2011-19\" src=\"https://dwrapps.utah.gov/HuntBoundaryImages/GRAY CYN FLIGHT LOCS 2011 TO 2019 SOUTH.jpg\">\n <br>\n<img class=\"imageLayout\" alt=\"BH Sheep Locations During Surveys 2011-19\" src=\"https://dwrapps.utah.gov/HuntBoundaryImages/GRAY CYN FLIGHT LOCS 2011 TO 2019 NORTH PART.jpg\"> \n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>\nIt is good to do pre-season scouting to learn country.  However, it is very hot on this unit during the summer months so plan accordingly.  You will need a good pair of binoculars and a spotting scope.  This unit looks a lot more like desert bighorn sheep habitat than Rocky Mountain bighorn habitat.  It is dry and cliffy.  During the summer you will most likely see groups of ewes, lambs, and young rams.  Many of the larger harvestable rams will not move in with the ewes and be available for harvest until the rut begins in late October.  Do not be alarmed if there are no big rams in the summer.  They will show up by November.  Hunting generally gets better the later you go.  The peak of the rut tends to be the week of Thanksgiving.  Find groups of ewes and lambs and often times a new ram will be with the ewe group each day as rams are moving alot in November between ewe groups.  If you need to get a feel for how to judge a ram, it is advised that you go to the town of Sunnyside during the summer months.  From April to September each year there is occasionally a group of 5 to 10 rams that reside in the east part of town and can be viewed at close range (<50 yards).  This is an excellent opportunity to judge sheep ages and trophy quality in a low stress environment.  Be advised that these sheep have been sporadic in their attendance in recent years will not be in Sunnyside in November when the hunt is going on.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nA way to cover lots of ground is to hike up on top of a canyon and glass the other side while having someone else hike the other side of the canyon and look back across the canyon toward you.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Behavior:</u>\nThe month of November is during the bighorn sheep rut.  Rams are moving from group to group looking for ewes.  Rams can also be observed butting heads.  It is advised to occasionally stop and listen for the sound of butting heads it can be a good tool for locating sheep that are otherwise difficult to see.  Sheep are generally active throughout the day in November but activity is highest in morning and evening.  Bighorn sheep will not be as tied to water in November as it is generally more available that time of year if it has snowed.  Bighorn will generally avoid the flat mesa top areas where there is any sort of tree cover.  They tend to be found on the steep open cliffs and are occasionally are feeding on the flat canyon bottoms or benches.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Ram vs Ewe:</u>\nBoth rams and ewes have horns.  Ram horns are much larger than ewe horns and will form a curl.  Many young rams will have a pronounced curl.  The best way to recognize mature trophy class bighorn rams is to look for horn mass particularly out near the tip of the horn.  Younger rams that are 3 to 5 years old will have plenty of horn length but the horn tips are very thin.  Mature rams 6 years and older tend to have thicker horns out near the tips, and thicker bases.  Often times if you are close enough you can count horn rings on rams to get an approximate age.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\nRocky Mountain Bighorn Sheep rut:</u>\nThe bighorn rut runs during late October and extends through early December with the peak in late November",
