			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a very remote, very rugged hunt unit.  Access is very difficult and will often require either a multiple day float trip down Desolation Canyon or long hikes which will require a descent of several thousand feet to the river bottom.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The general area you will be hunting is called Desolation Canyon.  It is appropriately named.  You will be in the middle of nowhere.  There is no cell coverage, no people, and no real roads to speak of.  Make sure people know where you are and when you will return.  Be very careful in attempting to navigate through the countless ledges in the canyon.  Do not go down through something you don't feel you can get back up.  This is a very deep canyon where the sun rarely shines in some portions.  Some slopes may have snow and be slick.  If you are planning to float the river, make sure you have an experienced oarsman and all of the correct equipment.  The river will be running low in November and be rather technical.  There are several Class 3 and 4 rapids along the 90 mile float trip required.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Highly variable.  November is a volatile month.  Prepare for winter-like conditions and be pleasantly surprised if the weather is nice.  The main access road in to the area on Cottonwood Ridge will remain open even if the snow piles up but most of the side roads will not.  There is the possibility that the river could freeze up in late November if it got really cold.  Generally the slow parts of the Green River do not freeze until mid to Late December.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "There is a good population of bighorn sheep in this area of approximately 70 to 100 sheep.  This resource has been underutilized so this hunt was created to provide sportsmen with an opportunity to exclusively hunt this area.  Most of the sheep reside between Rockhouse Canyon on the North to Flat Canyon on the south with the highest concentrations of sheep near the mouth of Jack Creek.  There are lots of layers to the canyon so sheep can be difficult to locate.  There are also a few more trees in the canyon than in most bighorn sheep habitat.  Most sheep tend to be in the bottom several layers of the canyon closer to the river, but they are occasionally seen on the ridgetops as well.  Main access points are Cottonwood Ridge and the Peters Point wellpads accessed from the Nine Mile Canyon road.  This will overlook Jack Creek from the north and will give you a good access point to hop in to the canyon.  A second way is to continue driving to Cedar Ridge which is south of Jack Creek.  There are locked gates on this road so your walk to the river will be much longer but it will be your closest access point to all points south of Jack Creek.  You can reach lower Horse Bench (near Rockhouse Canyon) with an ATV by taking a trail from the Sand Wash boat ramp that crosses Nine Mile Creek and goes up on Horse Bench.  The final access point would be floating the river.  This takes 4 days and roughly 90 miles and can be a bit tricky at low water levels and a bit cold. Please consult the Price BLM office for permitting and regulations regarding float trips on Desolation Canyon.  <img class=\"imageLayout\" alt=\"BH Sheep Locations from Survey 2011-2019\" src=\"https://dwrapps.utah.gov/HuntBoundaryImages/JACK CR FLIGHT LOCS 2011 TO 2019.jpg\">",
