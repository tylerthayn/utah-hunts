This road is really \nROAD CLOSURE CONSIDERATIONS The key objective is to construct these roadway improvements while minimizing impacts to public users. To facilitate public safety, certain segments of the road will be closed during various construction activities. When the road is open, delays up to 30 minutes can be expected. The construction schedule is subject to change. During road closures, no motorized vehicles will be permitted on the route. Adjacent Off Highway Vehicle (OHV) trail routes will continue to be open during road closures. Where a potential conflict between an OHV and construction equipment is possible, the OHV access will be restricted for public safety. Emergency access will be permitted at all times.\nROAD CLOSURE PRELIMINARY SCHEDULE\na combination of three smaller routes, Sheep Creek – Rays Valley Road (FR 70051); Unicorn Ridge – Indian Creek Road (FR 70042); and West Side Strawberry Road (FR 70131). The construction work will be split into four segments: Segment 1 (FR 70051) begins at the MP 0.0 (intersection with US-6) and ends at MP 7.0 (FR 70042). The work on Segment 1 consists of pavement rehabilitation including patching, crack sealing, and chip sealing. Segment 2 and Segment 3 (FR 70042) begins at MP 7.0 and ends at FR 70131. The work on Segment 2 and 3 consists of roadway bench widening, paving, drainage improvements, and safety improvements. Segment 4 (FR 70131) begins at the intersection with FR 70042 and ends 3.75 miles north of the intersection. The work on Segment 4 consists of pavement rehabilitation, pulverizing, and paving with subexcavation as needed.\nQUESTIONS?
