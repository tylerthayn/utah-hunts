			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Henry's bison are truly free-ranging, held and managed under the public trust doctrine and are considered a Conservation Herd. They are genetically pure having ancestral roots from the last few dozens of the American Bison which were protected and saved in Yellowstone National Park in the late 1800s. It is remarkable that this herd makes its home now on the Henry Mountains and the surrounding canyons, mesas, and valleys. The herd is a treasure, thanks to those early conservation-minded sportsmen who got them here.<br>\n<br> \nThis is truly a once in a lifetime hunt, with challenges, as most hunts are. With beautiful vistas of the area while hunting such an iconic animal the rewards are memorable for those who are able to draw this permit or participate in the hunt. Hunting a bison is challenging, especially with a bow due to the size and hardiness of the animal. The hunter who applies for this permit should be a very experienced and proficient archer having the confidence to place the arrow in the kill zone to minimize the suffering and wounding of the animal. Bison running around with arrows sticking out of them will likely result in negative public perception of archers and put in jeopardy the future of this archery hunt. Realize too that you will have company on the hunt. It can be very crowded, especially early on in the hunt, this will taper off if you are still hunting later on as more and more hunting camps take their buffalo home.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Henry Mountain range is remote and services are many miles away.  Have good tires with extra spares, the roads are known for flat tires and it is not uncommon to have a couple flats.  Late fall rains can result in flash floods and very muddy conditions. Roads can be washed out from storms many miles away leaving you with few exit points so be prepared. On later season hunts high mountain roads can become iced up and unsafe to travel (chains may help to get you where you want to be). Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but will not always connect. Consider hand held radios and a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Keep abreast of the weather forecast.  Be prepared for inclement weather.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "0~325 adults (post season)~295 adults (post season)~~~~~~~~~~For more detailed information on population and objective data please see the <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/big-game/annual-reports.html\" target=\"_blank\">Big Game Annual Report Page</a>.",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Lower elevation bison range is extrememly dry due to the ongoing drought and herds will most likely spend more time at higher elevations on the mountain where there is more available forage and where water is more available closer to the source. The past few years after coming off the winter range, bison have settled more on the slopes of Mt. Pennell and Mt. Ellen except that there has been less use on the east side. Often used lower elevation areas include the Airplane Springs, 5 and 7 Canyons of Tarantula Mesa, Apple Brush Flat, Stevens Mesa, Cedar Creek and Oak Creek Benches, and Sawmill Basin. There has been very little bison use on Mt. Hillers and Tarantula Mesa. Expect bison to move away from busy roads and hunting pressure while also traveling longer distances in search of forage. Traditionally herds eventually move south/southwest to the wintering areas of Cave Flat, Swap Mesa, Muley Creek and Bullfrog Creek drainages as hunting pressure increases through November and December. These areas have not received the precipitation needed to produce the forage for these herds. As a result bison may enter into Capital Reef National Park to find residual forage from the previous growing season, return to the mountain, or possibly venture to nontraditional areas to obtain forage.   <br>There is a seasonal road closure November 1 to May 15 on the Cave Flat road and hunting in this area usually requires horses. If you access the Cave Flat road prior to November 1st with vehicles, please do not venture off the designated Cave Flat road. Doing so threatens future access and can push bison farther away from the mesa making it more difficult to find bison. Please follow the BLM travel regulations and report anyone leaving a designated road.\n<br>\n\nA bison is a big animal to take care of. A mature cow can weigh as much as a thousand pounds and a mature bull as much as 2000 pounds so it's a good idea to have at least two people to help with a harvested animal. There have been individuals who have done well on their own but the challenge is to keep the animal from spoiling and not wasting any meat. Keep in mind that all the bison do not go out to the winter range while the hunts are going on. Bison are very good at hiding, holding tight, and sometimes moving a lot. Not all the bison leave the mountain even on the last hunt in December.  Bison are very good at hiding, holding tight, and sometimes moving a lot. There is also an orientation for cow hunters that may be of help to you. You may view the cow bison orientation course online at http://wildlife.utah.gov/dwr/hunting/hunting-information/big-game.html   There you will find information on what to expect hunting bison, help in determining a bull from a cow, horn growth that can be helpful in deciding which animal you may want to harvest, and what equipment you might find useful.<br><br><br>\n\nIf you draw a permit you may receive a blood collection kit in the mail. By following the kits instruction you will play a critical role in the management and conservation of the Henry Mountains bison herd and North American bison in general by helping collect a blood sample for disease testing from your animal if you are successful.  We are asking that you follow the instructions and make every effort to collect this sample correctly and send it in promptly.  Not every hunter will receive a blood collection kit.<br><br>\nDuring the winters of 2011 and 2013, 77 adult bison on the Henry Mountains were captured and fitted with GPS and/or VHF radio collars for a long-term research project monitoring bison movements and survival. If you harvest a collared bison, it is very important that we receive the collar(s) in order to download stored GPS data and reuse the collar/s. Please do not cut the collar off. Doing so makes the collar unusable, and they are very expensive to replace. A small adjustable wrench or multi-tool pliers can remove the collar fasteners/nuts. If the threaded posts are bent pliers may be needed to twist or break off the posts. The cape of a harvested collared bison may show some wear from a collar.<br><br>\nAfter harvesting it is critical to get your buffalo skinned and cooled as soon as possible.  A buffalo can spoil if left unskinned overnight, even in sub-freezing temperatures.  Splitting or quartering will also facilitate cooling, be prepared to saw through over two feet of backbone at the hump when splitting a bison. October temperatures can still be warm so be prepared to take care of your animal and get it cooled down as quickly as possible. <br><br>\n<u>Starter Hunting Checklist</u><br>\n\n 1.  Minimum of two individuals to help you<br>\n\n 2.  Large, sturdy meat saw/battery powered reciprocating saw plus extra batteries<br>\n\n 3.  Axe<br>\n\n 4.  Minimum of two sharp knives<br>\n\n 5.  Sharpening stone <br>\n\n 6.  Ton capacity block and tackle<br>\n\n 7.  Rope<br>\n\n 8.  Plenty of large sturdy game bags<br>\n\n 9.  Large tarp<br>\n\n10.  Salt for cape and hide<br>\n\n11.  Maps 1:100,000 scale  (Hanksville, Hite Crossing, Escalante, Loa)<br>\n\n12.  Tire chains<br>\n<br>\n<u>Location of Harvest:</u> Bison on the Henry Mountains are mostly found from 5,000'-10,000' elevation. During October most of the bison herds have been on the west side of Mt Ellen and Mt Pennell. Fewer are harvested on the east and southern sides of Mt. Pennell as in years past but the southern end has held a small bison herd each year. Except for the Stanton Pass area between Mt Hillers and Pennell there has been little harvest on Mt Hillers historically. Occasionally bison are harvested on the north and east sides/canyons of Tarantula Mesa. It is rare to find bison on top of Tarantula Mesa, it is large and a lot of time can be spent without success.<br><br>\n<u>Migration:</u> In the spring, bison herds migrate back to the mountains from the southern winter range moving around the west and east sides of Mt Pennell.  In recent years these bison migrate on to the western/northwestern slopes and lower benches and flats of Mt Ellen where they herd up in large numbers for the summer rut. They continue to stay in this area up until the first hunt in November.  Not all the bison migrate however to the winter range. Individual bulls and a small herd or two have wintered on the mountain at higher elevations.<br><br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u> Locating bison is not always easy. The Henry Mountains are rough and there are plenty of areas for buffalo to hide out, so don't be surprised when you find that this really is a \"hunt\".  Use good clean optics and glass often.  Glassing often from vantage points that offer a wide expanse of country is a good strategy. From these vantage points you'll often see bison in areas that are inaccessible to vehicles. You can also easily miss them in smaller openings in the timber so glass often along your travels. Bison most often graze in open areas throughout the day. There are many chaining's/seeding's where pinion-juniper habitat has been mechanically altered and opened up in favor of grasses and shrubs. These are good places to look, as well as any high elevation meadows, pass's/saddles, or ridges.<br><br>\nAlthough some bison herds are not bothered by vehicle traffic or people, the Henry Mountains herds usually avoid human activity. Prior to opening morning bison are often times easily located in larger herds but come opening morning, having been made wary of all the scouting activity in the area and the setting up of camps nearby, hunters often find that the bison are nowhere to be found. Subsequently harvest on opening weekend can be very low.  Bison will move to secluded areas away from pressure where they are sometimes very difficult to find. As hunting pressure increases bison move towards the wintering areas of Cave Flat and beyond. A few hunters are lucky enough to harvest a bison close to a road, but for most it’s much more difficult.<br><br>\nGenerally, bulls are considerably larger in body size with a more massive diameter horn base and overall horn size. Along the underside of the animal, the penile sheath is usually evident on mature bulls, but not a reliable characteristic of younger bulls. Yearling bulls have horns that have a large diameter base and grow outward more than female bison. Cows have similar shaped horns as younger bulls but are typically much thinner and appear slightly more curved. Young bulls, especially yearlings and two year olds, have some similar horn characteristics of younger and mature cows, are difficult to distinguish, and are sometimes taken for a cow during the cow hunt.  When the time comes that you are determining what buffalo to shoot, make sure that you take your time and look at all the identifying characteristics, (see the 'Identifying Characteristics' in the Cow Bison orientation), before shooting. A successful archer, by using terrain and trees for cover should be able to get in close enough range to make a one shot kill and not disturb the herd. Bison will easily wind a hunter. If the herd runs after the animal is shot, the hit animal may be able to also run for some time and it may be difficult to find it again. Make sure the animal has bled out prior to disturbing the herd it was with.<br><br>\n<u>Behavior:</u> Bison are active most of the day and generally water 1-2 times/day but they can also go a couple days without water. They have been observed traveling 5 miles to water.  Herds are composed of cows, calves and bulls, and will follow the lead of an older cow.  Bison rut mid-July to early September. Not all bulls will leave the herd and form bachelor groups outside of the rut.  In steeper terrain and when moving from danger they will single out and travel on the many trails that are available to them. Bison are highly mobile and can travel for miles without stopping when they decide to move.  When grazing they will move together fanning out and when resting or loafing some will feed while others rest. Some older bulls are found alone or together in small numbers away from the herds, other bulls of varying age classes will also bachelor up into small groups. When hunted some larger herds will break-up into smaller herds and bulls will often times be in these herds throughout the hunt.\n",
