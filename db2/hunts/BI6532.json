			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Book Cliffs offers a challenging landscape. There are large ridges with steep canyons dividing them. Most of the canyons and ridges have roads or ATV trails to provide access. There are plenty of areas to hike and get away from the main roads. The Seep Ridge road is the best way to access where the bison are located. You can stay on this road until you come to the Book Cliffs Divide. Once on the Divide road I would travel west to Winter Ridge and Rock Springs Mesa.<br>\nTake every opportunity to scout for this hunt. Judging bulls can be difficult especially if they are by themselves. I would bring a GPS or a good map that shows land status to make sure you are not trespassing on Ute Tribal land. If you have access to ATVs, they would be very helpful while hunting this area. Bulls will usually have large body size than cows. Bulls’ horns will be larger and will not curve in as much as cows. The bulls will have a tuft of hair that will hang down on their bellies. Most cows will have a calf or a yearling that will stay fairly close to them. The larger bulls can weigh over 2,000 lbs. and their hide is very thick, and if not skinned right away the meat could spoil even in cold temperatures. I would bring plenty of help, sharp knives, and a big bore rifle. This area has the potential for Boone and Crockett quality bulls. ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a GPS type of messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightning, and snow. Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "~~~~~~~~~~~~",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Location of harvest: Some good bison areas are: Winter Ridge, Meadow Creek, Kelly Canyon, Cedar Camp, Willow Flats, Cherry Mesa, Rock Springs Mesa, Park Ridge, Wood Canyon, Reservoir Canyon, along Seep Ridge and Indian Ridge, and Moon Ridge. I have seen lone bulls as far east as Big Park, close to the Colorado state line. Early in the Fall Winter Ridge is a great area to locate bison. They must stay relatively close to a sustainable water source until there is a sufficient amount of snow. <br>\n<br>\nScouting Tips: A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential. I would spend the majority of the time scouting on Winter Ridge. Winter Ridge is a large area with a lot of sagebrush flats, some burned areas, and thick pinyon/juniper. To the west is Kelly Canyon and Meadow Creek. Both of these canyons usually have water in them. There are also a few springs in the canyons that lead off of Winter Ridge.\nThere are several herds that on occasion spend time along The Seep Ridge Road from Wood Canyon to Park Ridge. They can be on either side of the road as far as 3-5 miles off the road. I would suggest scouting areas surrounding Winter Ridge, like: Rock Springs Mesa, Main Canyon, and Wood Canyon. Trail cameras are a great scouting tool. I would try to locate springs or guzzlers that appear to have high bison use and set up trail cameras. <br>\n<br>\nBehavior: During the late summer early fall bison rut. The bulls will mostly be in the large herds. During the rut there will be several mature bulls competing for herds of cows. Younger bulls will start to wander during this time to avoid the large mature bulls and look for other more available cows. Later in the fall bulls will start to bachelor back up into small herds of 2-7 animals. The cows and calves will be in larger herds but similar areas. I have observed calves of different sizes, suggesting that the cows could be coming into estrus outside of this time. Once the snow is deep enough they won’t be tied to water sources. Bison are active most of the day. They will bed down in open areas where they have good visual vantage points to chew their cud. They will typically drink 1-2 times a day. They spend the majority of their time grazing. ",
