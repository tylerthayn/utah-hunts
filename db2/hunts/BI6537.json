			"CAMPGRND_INFO": "Suggested Maps: BLM: Vernal, West Water, and they have a general map that labels most of the main roads. \nDWR WMA’S: UDWR WMAs is limited to 14 days at one location.  \nThere are no established campgrounds in this unit, it is a first-come first-served basis.  Some hunters prefer to camp at the trailheads.  There are DWR cabins in this unit that are not for public use.  There is no camping allowed within a quarter mile of a DWR cabin.  \n\nThe trails are seasonally maintained by the DWR, and sportsmen.  \n",
			"PRIM_ACCESS_PTS": "There are two trailheads for the roadless area, a north and a south.  The north access is called the Ten Mile Knoll trailhead.   If you take Utah State Road 88, it is located between Vernal and Roosevelt.  Follow SR 88 south and it turns into the Seep Ridge Road.  The Seep Ridge Rd splits and becomes the Divide Rd.  If you take the Divide Rd west the trail head is at the start of Steer Ridge.  There is a sign at the parking area.  It is a large parking area but it can fill up in a hurry with trucks and horse trailers.  The Hay Canyon Rd is the main access road on the south side of the Book Cliffs.  You can access it from I-70.  It is a hard packed dirt/gravel road.  The Steer Ridge Rd can be very dangerous if it has been snowing or raining but it can dry out quickly.\n\nThe south trail head starts at the top of Sego Canyon.  The road starts at Thompson Springs in Grand County and continues up the Sego Canyon Rd; follow it to the end of the road.  There is a water trough at the trailhead but it is not always full of water.  This trailhead can also fill up with vehicles and trailers.  There are no bathrooms or other facilities at either of these trailheads, so plan accordingly.    \n",

The Roadless/Little Creek unit prohibits the use of any mechanized vehicles.  This includes bikes, E-Bikes, game carts, hand carts and etc.  The south unit doesn't prohibit the use of mechanized vehicles.  \n\nThe Book Cliffs offers a challenging landscape.  There are large ridges with steep canyons dividing them.  \n",

Once you leave the Sego Trailhead parking area and start down the Went Ridge trail you are on Tribal land for the first few miles.  There are signs indicating that you have permission from the Tribe to use this route.  We ask that you please keep this area clean and stay on the main trail until you are off of Ute Tribal land.  This is a privilege and abuse of this area could lead to sportsmen losing this access permit.  This hunt excludes all Ute Tribal lands.",
