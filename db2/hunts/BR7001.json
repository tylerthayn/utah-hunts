			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The spring hunt historically has the highest success out of all the bear hunts in the Book Cliffs.  Most hunters prefer to use hounds during this hunt.  The majority of harvest occurs the last 10 days of the hunt.  Be prepared to cover several miles every day cutting tracks, and looking for sign. It can be difficult hunting near the Colorado border and occasionally I have seen hunters have to retrieve their dogs across the hunt boundary.  The bears will be close to there dens at the first of the hunt.  They prefer the slopes with ledge rock to den in.  I would hunt early in the day while the bears are out and the temps are cool.  The snow level usually doesn't cause many problems during the spring hunt.  <br>\nSome hunters prefer to spot and stalk.  This can be considerably more difficult compared to hunting with hounds, but it can be an effective way to hunt.  There is no baiting during this hunt.  If you find any illegal baits please contact the UDWR in Vernal (435) 781-9453.  I would focus my efforts in areas where I have good visual vantage points.  Areas like: Rat Hole Cyn, Rail Road Cyn, Moon Ridge, and similar areas.  Be prepared to hike in steep, rocky terrain.<br>\n<br><br>\nThe majority of the region has a good deal of road access. This hunt unit offers some areas that are closed to vehicle access.  These areas hold bears but can be difficult to hunt and don’t receive as much pressure.  The Meadow Creek WMA, and parts of the Bitter Creek WMA are two of these areas.    ",

They move the most during the early morning hours and the evening.  The boars are more likely to come out of there dens first.  They will continue to increase their movements as the hunt progresses.
