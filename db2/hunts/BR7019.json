Typically bears can be found away from major roads and ATV trails. Please reference the<a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting/main-hunting-page/black-bear.html\" target=\"_blank\"> Utah Black Bear Guidebook </a> and familiarize yourself on all rules and regulations related to bear hunting in Utah.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cell phone coverage is spotty at best. Hunters are encouraged to use a \"spot tracker\" device in areas without good cell coverage. Road conditions may be difficult in remote areas. Hunters should prepare for muddy roads and occasional snowdrifts which will make travel difficult.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Weather conditions can be unpredictable and hunters should prepare accordingly.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "~~~~~~~~~~~~",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Bears will emerge from winter dens in late March through early April depending on weather conditions. Males typically leave dens 1-2 weeks prior to females. Open areas with newly emerging grass and forbs such as meadows and old burns will attract bears in the early weeks of this hunt. South facing slopes with open areas of mixed conifer can be especially productive early on. Hunter harvest has been primarily in the Chalk Creek portion of the unit. Again, this unit is mostly private property and hunters will need written permission to gain access. Please respect private property.",
