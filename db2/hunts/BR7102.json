			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt unit is in a very remote location and can be difficult to access to replenish baits.  The unit offers a high bear density.  Look for scat piles and tracks on the trails.  There are several riparian areas and springs the bears will be accessing.  Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get your bait sites approved before your hunt starts.  As soon as you can start baiting I would.  Avoid areas within 1/4-1/2 mile from the main trails.  The frequency of horse traffic on the trails can lead to problems if there is a bear bait close to them.  I would hunt on Little Creek Ridge.  It has a very high bear density.      ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a remote area with no vehicle access.  Every year sportsmen injure horses and themselves while riding in the rough terrain.  Be prepared for adverse weather, and limited cell phone coverage.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Be prepared for hot/dry conditions, with occasional thunder storms.  The trails can get extremely slick and dangerous.",

Some hunters prefer to camp at the trailheads.  There are DWR cabins in this unit that are not for public use.  There is no camping allowed within a quarter mile of a DWR cabin.  \n\nThe trails are seasonally maintained by the DWR, and sportsmen.  \n",

If you take Utah State Road 88, it is located between Vernal and Roosevelt.  Follow SR 88 south and it turns into the Seep Ridge Road.  The Seep Ridge Rd splits and becomes the Divide Rd.  If you take the Divide Rd west the trail head is at the start of Steer Ridge.  There is a sign at the parking area.  It is a large parking area but it can fill up in a hurry with trucks and horse trailers.  The Hay Canyon Rd is the main access road on the south side of the Book Cliffs.  You can access it from I-70.  It is a hard packed dirt/gravel road.  The Steer Ridge Rd can be very dangerous if it has been snowing or raining but it can dry out quickly.\n\nThe south trail head starts at the top of Sego Canyon.  The road starts at Thompson Springs in Grand County and continues up the Sego Canyon Rd; follow it to the end of the road.  There is a water trough at the trailhead but it is not always full of water.  This trailhead can also fill up with vehicles and trailers.  There are no bathrooms or other facilities at either of these trailheads, so plan accordingly.    \n",
