			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a summer hunt that provides opportunity for bait or spot and stalk hunting.  There typically will be relatively few tags issued so hunting pressure will be light, however during this time of year there are an abundance of other users on the mountain.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "There is very little cell coverage on this mountain despite it's proximity to the Wasatch Front.  Expect muddy roads and cool springtime conditions at high elevations in early June.  Be careful where you set bait out.  There are a lot of people recreating on the mountain this time of year and you don't want to attract bears to areas they should not be.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Depending on winter conditions there may be snowdrifts that persist at high elevations along Trough Springs Ridge, North Skyline Drive, and Bean and Granger Ridges in early June.",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "~~~~~~~~~~~~",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Almost the entire mountain is good bear habitat so you can't go terribly wrong on this unit.  Be aware of a large block of private land on the northeast portion of the unit near Scofield Reservoir.  Although in some cases private landowners tend to be a bit more amenable to allowing hunting for bears on their lands than they are for big game so it doesn't hurt to ask for permission if you have an area you'd really like to hunt.  Most people have success hunting the high country during this hunt.  All of the ridges and canyons draining off of North Skyline Drive are good as well as Trough Springs Ridge, Bean Ridge, Granger Ridge, and Gentry Mountain.  One of the purposes of this hunt is to allow hunters to harvest bears that typically get in trouble later in the summer when domestic sheep arrive.  The areas mentioned above are predominantly public land and typically have herds of domestic sheep on them in July and are frequented by bears.  ",
