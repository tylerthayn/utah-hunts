			"SAFETY_CONS": "Any legal weapon is allowed for this hunt (including firearms).  Be certain of your target before pointing your weapon. Rifle scopes should never be used as binoculars.<br>\nCellular phone coverage can be spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return if you camp out.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.<br>\n<br>\nBears can be unpredictable and caution should be taken when hunting them.",

Harvesting bears in the same locations each year leads to over harvest of mature adults in that area.  Be aware of air current flow as you pick your hunting spot.  Bears have amazing noses and can wind hunters easily and then will only come to the bait after dark when it is not legal harvest them.  <br>\nHunter success using the Spot & Stalk method has been very low on this unit.  It is rare to see a bear on this unit without bait or hounds.",
