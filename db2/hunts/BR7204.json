			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Please reference the Black Bear Guide Book and be familiar with the rules and regulations concerning hunting bears in Utah. On this hunt, hounds and spot and stalk hunting are allowed. Baiting is allowed during the second half or late season of this hunt. Early baiting is not allowed prior to the opening of the second or later season of this hunt.\n<br><br>\nDesirable bait site locations are almost always away from roads and atv trails and where there are denser conifer stands with water nearby. With that in mind do not violate UtahCode § 23-20-3 and Utah Admin. Rule R657-33-14: You may not place bait in either of the following areas: Within 100 yards of water, a public road or a designated trail. Or within a half-mile of any permanent dwelling or campground. There may be additional bait-placement restrictions, depending upon historical human and bear activity—especially nuisance complaints within any given area. The site that you choose to place a bait should not put other people using that same area at risk. Seek other suitable locations if other campers or resource users are nearby.<br><br>\n \nOftentimes, multiple bears will come into a bait station and hunters need to know how to tell whether it is a male or female. Be sure of the bear you are shooting, that it does not have cubs of the year with it or evidence that it is a female that has cubs. A female with new cubs is illegal to pursue or harvest. The required black bear orientation course can be found here: <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-in-utah/hunting-information/black-bears.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-in-utah/hunting-information/black-bears.html</a> \n<br>\n<br>\n \nApply early for a certificate of registration (COR) to run a bait station which a can take upwards of ten days.<br>\n<br>\n\nThis hunt coincides with big game hunts, there will be many other users enjoying their pursuits, please be considerate of one another.<br>\n<br>\n\nHunters need to know how to tell whether it is a male or female. Be sure of the bear you are shooting, that it does not have cubs of the year with it or evidence that it is a female with cubs less than one year old. A female with new cubs is illegal to pursue or harvest. The required black bear orientation course can be found here: <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-in-utah/hunting-information/black-bears.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-in-utah/hunting-information/black-bears.html</a><br>\n<br>\n\nIf you find any illegal baits, please report them to the UDWR promptly.\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "You can find resources on safety in black bear country on the division’s website here: <a href=\"https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-in-utah/hunting-information/black-bears.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://wildlife.utah.gov/hunting-in-utah/hunting-information/black-bears.html</a>\n\nCellular phone coverage can be spotty on this hunt unit. A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service, it also allows a designated person with internet service to track you. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n",

Plan to focus your efforts on August and September.\n<br>\n<br>\n\nHunting bears on or near sheep allotments on the south Manti is encouraged to help decrease the number of bears taken by Wildlife Services- Dept. of AG each year for killing domestic sheep. Not all bears kill sheep, but if sportsmen take some of the bears that do, there will be more opportunity for sportsmen to harvest bears. These allotments are generally higher in elevation reaching to Skyline Drive. <br>\n<br>\nOther areas on the S. Manti include Huntington and Cottonwood canyons and the following mountains: East, Trail, Candland, Heliotrope, Ferron, and the White Mtn area. Another area not to be overlooked is along the Price River between Woodside and Cedar Mountain; we have had a number of reports of black bear sign along this river corridor.",
