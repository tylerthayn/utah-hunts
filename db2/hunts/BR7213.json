Hunters can choose to use dogs, spot and stalk, or use bait on this hunt. If you choose to use bait during this hunt, please make sure to follow the rules do not apply for a bait station near homes/cabins, campgrounds and water sources.  Also, if you end up using dogs, do not start them on a bear track within a several miles of your bait station.  Sweet baits and meats that are very aromatic seems to work best for bear.

There are several other big game hunts going on, on this unit during this hunts time frame.  ",
