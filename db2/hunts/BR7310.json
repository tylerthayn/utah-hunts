			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Boulder Mountain has a great bear population but it is a rugged, large, tough place to hunt. Vehicle access is limited and the steep, rocky terrain makes it a challenging experience. The DWR has several radio collars on female bears and would ask that hunters not harvest a bear with a collar on this unit.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "The Boulder is a tough place to hunt. Take plenty of water and always tell someone where you plan to hunt. Be prepared to spend the night in the backcountry in case your hunt goes south on you. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Weather is unpredictable and can change suddenly. Snow can fall anytime of the year especially at high elevations. Nights can be very cold. ",
			"MANAGEMENT_OBJ": "~~~~~~~~~~~~",
			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Please don't harvest our radio collared bears! Boars usually prefer the higher elevations on the Boulder and sows with cubs often don't leave the oak/mountain brush zones around the mountain. All parts of the mountain have populations of bears and pre-season scouting and hiking will help hunters find good areas. Game cameras are very popular and the Boulder has cameras all over it. There are many lakes and streams on the Boulder and these are areas where bears like to feed and lounge. Often when trailing bears with hounds you can expect to cover large areas of country while pursuing. Hunting with a guide on the Boulder is a good idea for some hunters.",
