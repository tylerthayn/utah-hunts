			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "Bear populations are doing well across the whole unit. This hunt allows you to hunt all legal seasons on the unit.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This hunt now allows legal firearms to be used. Be certain of your target before pointing your weapon. Rifle scopes should never be used as binoculars.\nCellular phone coverage can be spotty on this hunt unit. Satellite phones do work in the area. A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service. Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return if you camp out.\n\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents. Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers. Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.\n\nBears can be unpredictable and caution should be taken when hunting them.\n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "There are bears across the whole unit. Look for areas away from campgrounds, roads, trails, and areas frequented by the general public. The more remote the area the better. Bears like areas close to water and cover. Streams flowing by conifers are good places to start. Use some kind of attractant such as anise oil or liquid fish fertilizer. Place attractant high in a tree so as to have the sent loft out. Bears can smell a mile away. Trail cameras are a good tool to use to find information on bears sex, age and time of day visiting the area. Some areas to look at are Strawberry valley, Sheep Creek, Diamond Fork, Hobble Creek, American Fork Canyon, but bears can be found in most all areas on the unit.. Hunters are encouraged to locate baits in areas not previously hunted if they are looking for a large boar. Harvesting bears in the same locations each year leads to over harvest of mature adults in that area. Be aware of air current flow as you pick your hunting spot. Bears have amazing noses and can wind hunters easily and then will only come to the bait after dark when it is not legal harvest them. \nHunter success using the Spot & Stalk method has been very low on this unit",
