Utah State Road 88 located between Vernal and Roosevelt.  As you follow it south it turns into the Seep Ridge Road.  Hwy 45 or the Bonanza Hwy is located east of Vernal.  It takes you towards the east side of the Book Cliffs.  After you cross the White River you come to the Dragon or Duck Rock intersection.  The Dragon Rd will take you south to the Book Cliffs.\n\nThe Hay Canyon Rd is the main access road on the south side of the Book Cliffs.  You can access it from I-70.  It is a hard packed dirt/gravel road.  \n\nThe roadless area has two access points, a north and a south.  The north access is called the Ten Mile Knoll trailhead.  It is located at the start of Steer Ridge.  There is a parking area, but it can fill up in a hurry with trucks and horse trailers.  The south trailhead starts at the top of Sego Canyon.  The road starts at Thompson Springs in Grand County and continues up the Sego Canyon Rd; follow it to the end of the road.  There is a water trough at the trailhead, but it is not always full of water.  This trailhead can also fill up with vehicles, and trailers.  There are no bathrooms or other facilities at either of these trailheads, so plan accordingly.    \n",

There are several county signs and BLM signs to help direct you.  \n\nThe Book Cliffs offers a challenging landscape.  There are large ridges with steep canyons dividing them.  Most of the canyons and ridges have roads or ATV trails to provide access.  There are plenty of areas to hike and get away from the main roads.  The hunting pressure will drastically decrease after opening weekend.  \n\nThere are two roads that allow you to drive across the majority of the Book Cliffs.  The Kings Well Rd starts at the Seep Ridge Rd on the west side, and it can take you all the way to the Dragon Rd on the east side.  The Indian Ridge Road starts at the Seep Ridge Rd and goes through the bottom of Sweet Water, top of McCook Ridge, Bitter Creek, and to Big Park.
