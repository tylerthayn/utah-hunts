			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "In the past this unit was a split unit, and the last few years it has been managed as a harvest objective.  There is great access to cut tracks and run hounds.  The main roads receive the most hunting pressure.  I wouldn't wait to long in the winter, because snow levels can keep certain roads in accessible.  There are several cougar hunting guides to use if you don't have your own hounds.  There are several hunters who choose to pursue and not kill which can make it difficult for hunters with kill tags.  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a very remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.\n\nThe Book Cliffs mountain range is one of the more remote areas in Utah.  There are no service stations for many miles.  Plan on bringing plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice.\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, and snow.  Storms can cause muddy road conditions and flash floods in this region.   ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Most hunters prefer to cut tracks early in the morning.  Hunters must be present when the hounds are turned loose.  Cougars are very solitary animals and can be very difficult to find.  Make sure you are checking the quota for this unit before you go out hunting.  Once the quota is filled the unit is closed.  Be sure to familiarize yourself with the cougar guide book before you start hunting.  <br>\n<br>\nHere are some major drainage's where hunters have had success in the past:  Atchee Ridge, Rainbow, Evacuation, Three Mile, Big Park, Cooper Cyn, McCook Ridge, Monument Ridge, Sweet Water, Rail Road Cyn, Indian Ridge, Seep Ridge, Winter Ridge, Willow Creek, Wood Cyn, and Buck Cyn.

Before you begin a hunting trip to a harvest objective unit, you must visit the Cougar Harvest Objective Page to verify that a unit is still open. The website will be updated each day by noon MST.

The DWR employee will affix a permanent possession tag to the pelt or unskinned carcass. You may not possess an unskinned carcass or green pelt after the 48 hour check-in period. If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",

Utah State Road 88 located between Vernal and Roosevelt.  As you follow it south it turns into the Seep Ridge Road.  Hwy 45 or the Bonanza Hwy is located east of Vernal.  It takes you towards the east side of the Book Cliffs.  After you cross the White River you come to the Dragon or Duck Rock intersection.  The Dragon Rd will take you south to the Book Cliffs.\n\nThe Hay Canyon Rd is the main access road on the south side of the Book Cliffs.  You can access it from I-70.  It is a hard packed dirt/gravel road.  \n\nThe roadless area has two access points, a north and a south.  The north access is called the Ten Mile Knoll trailhead.  It is located at the start of Steer Ridge.  There is a parking area, but it can fill up in a hurry with trucks and horse trailers.  The south trailhead starts at the top of Sego Canyon.  The road starts at Thompson Springs in Grand County and continues up the Sego Canyon Rd; follow it to the end of the road.  There is a water trough at the trailhead, but it is not always full of water.  This trailhead can also fill up with vehicles, and trailers.

There are several county signs and BLM signs to help direct you.  \n\nThe Book Cliffs offers a challenging landscape.  There are large ridges with steep canyons dividing them.  Most of the canyons and ridges have roads or ATV trails to provide access.  There are plenty of areas to hike and get away from the main roads.  The hunting pressure will drastically decrease after opening weekend.  \n\nThere are two roads that allow you to drive across the majority of the Book Cliffs.  The Kings Well Rd starts at the Seep Ridge Rd on the west side, and it can take you all the way to the Dragon Rd on the east side.  The Indian Ridge Road starts at the Seep Ridge Rd and goes through the bottom of Sweet Water, top of McCook Ridge, Bitter Creek, and to Big Park.
