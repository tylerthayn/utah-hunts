			"WEATHER_CONS": "This area consists almost entirely of steep rugged canyons.  These canyons will be prone to flash flooding during and after periods of rainfall.  Most of the unit occurs at relatively low elevations so snow tends not to accumulate.  Snow does tend to persist in the bottoms of these canyons as they receive very little sunlight.  The upper elevations in upper Range Creek, Rattlesnake, Tushar, and Floy Canyons usually receive good snowfall but are difficult to access",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This hunt targets cougars that prey primarily on bighorn sheep.  Cougar densities are likely fairly low due to relatively low prey densities compared to higher elevation ranges where cougars primarily prey on deer and elk.  This rough, rocky country that is tough on dogs.  Snow will melt off the south facing slopes relatively quickly.  Bighorn sheep reside primarily in the canyons surrounding the lower Price River from Woodside to the Confluence and along the lower Green River and the major canyons flowing in to it.  Good canyons where bighorn sheep (and likely cougars) reside include Poverty, Rattlesnake, Butler, Swasey, Tushar, Coal, Horse, Floy, and Sego Canyons on the east side of the Green River.  On the west side of the Green River one can find good habitat in lower Range Creek, Long Canyon, Short Canyon, Sand Knolls Canyon, and Jenny Canyons.  Very few cougars are harvested here.",

Before you begin a hunting trip to a harvest objective unit, you must visit the Cougar Harvest Objective Page to verify that a unit is still open. The website will be updated each day by noon MST. Updates become effective the following day, 30 minutes before official sunrise. Effective for the 2021-22 season, there will no longer be a phone line available to check for open units.",

The DWR employee will affix a permanent possession tag to the pelt or unskinned carcass. You may not possess an unskinned carcass or green pelt after the 48 hour check-in period. If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",
