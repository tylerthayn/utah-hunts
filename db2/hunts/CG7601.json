			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a Split hunt unit.   This unit encompasses aspen, open sagebrush, pinyon/juniper woodlands, and desert scrub.  Hunters can expect to see cougars on private land within the unit.  Hunters should receive written permission from private landowners prior to the start of the hunt if they wish to hunt private property.   Most roads and ATV trails on this unit are managed by Box Elder County or BLM and are covered on their Travel Management Plans.  Please direct all questions regarding which roads and trails ATVs can be operated on to the BLM.\n<br>\nBLM: <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/salt_lake.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.blm.gov/ut/st/en/fo/salt_lake.html</a>\n<br>\nBox Elder County:   <a href=\"http://www.boxeldercounty.org/box-elder-county-web-map.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.boxeldercounty.org/box-elder-county-web-map.htm</a>\n",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.  Services are available in Grouse Creek, Snowville, Montello, Nevada, or Wendover, Utah/Nevada.  ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area at higher elevations.  At lower elevations, most years the snow will either melt off or blow away within a day or two until through the first week of December. ",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "Cougars in this unit move back and forth across private and public property  Cougars are found throughout much of the unit, but are concentrated along the Grouse Creek Mtn Range, Hansel Mtns, and West Hills near Tremonton.  Success improves if hunters can be on the mountain after any fresh snowfall.  Higher elevations of each mountain range are steep and rugged providing ample escape terrain for cougars.  Use caution when accessing these areas. Early spring snowstorms create hunting opportunity for the harvest objective portion of this hunt.",

Before you begin a hunting trip to a harvest objective unit, you must visit the Cougar Harvest Objective Page to verify that a unit is still open. The website will be updated each day by noon MST. Updates become effective the following day, 30 minutes before official sunrise. Effective for the 2021-22 season, there will no longer be a phone line available to check for open units.",

The DWR employee will affix a permanent possession tag to the pelt or unskinned carcass. You may not possess an unskinned carcass or green pelt after the 48 hour check-in period. If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",
