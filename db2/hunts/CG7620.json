Game cameras are very popular and the Thousand Lakes has cameras all over it. Often when trailing cougars with hounds you can expect to cover large areas of country while pursuing. Hunting with a guide on the Boulder is a good idea for some hunters.<br>\nCapitol Reef National Park is located on the eastern portions of this unit.

If you need to reach a Division employee after regular business hours, over a weekend, or on a holiday, contact your local police dispatch. In addition, you cannot ship a green pelt out of the state of Utah or present it to a taxidermist if the pelt does not have a permanent possession tag attached.",
