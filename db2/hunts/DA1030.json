			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "There is a growing population of deer inhabiting not only the farmlands, but the neighborhoods in the communities of Helper, Kenilworth, Spring Glen, Carbonville, Price, and Wellington.  This hunt is intended to help control this population in a manner that is safe while providing hunter opportunity.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "You will be hunting in close proximity to people's homes.  Please be very certain of your target and what is behind it.  It would be wise to not only secure permission from the property owner you would like to hunt on but also on surrounding property owners in the event that the deer wanders on to neighboring properties.  Please be very aware that not every property owner has the same opinion on hunting.  It would be advisable to hunt in a manner that will not attract attention to yourself as to minimize any negative public perceptions that could occur with wounded animals, gutpiles in people's yards etc.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "It is hot in August and September.  Be prepared to harvest your animal quickly and efficiently, and get it field dressed, skinned, and cooled off as quick as possible in order to avoid the possibility of spoilage.  Meat will spoil very quickly if not cooled off immediately.",
