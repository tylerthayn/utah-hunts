			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "After numerous complaints from residents, the town council of Oak City convened and supported a city-wide archery hunt as an option to mitigate problems caused by urban mule deer. The weapon type is archery only. There are empty lots and other open spaces in between residential areas where hunters can safely harvest does with archery equipment. Hunters will need written permission from landowners. This hunt is specifically designed to target resident mule deer living within the city limits of Oak City. There is no public land within this hunt boundary. Hunters should not apply unless they have access secured to a private property within the boundary that has mule deer present. The season dates are purposely set early in the fall to ensure there is no harvest of migratory does that will come off the Oak Creek mountains later in the year. ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "All archery hunters should be extremely careful about what shots they're willing to take. This hunt though will require an extra level of conscientiousness to determine safe shots given the density of people in the area. ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "Temperatures will be hot and could range anywhere from approximately 70 to 110 degrees. Depending on the year, we sometimes get monsoon rains during this timeframe. Monsoon moisture can bring a lot of rain, but if we don't get rain it'll likely be hot and dry.   ",
