			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a Limited Entry hunt unit and is managed for 25-35 bucks per 100 does.  These are late season hunts, during the rut, 150 inch bucks are not uncommon.  Hunters should be aware of the Utah/Colorado state line boundary.  Utah hunters are not permitted to hunt in Colorado.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cell phone service is very limited on this unit.  It is a good idea to let someone know where you are and when you will return.  I would recommend having a four-wheel drive vehicle during this hunt, with tire chains or a tow strap, just in case.  Late season snow storms can settle in on this unit, causing some roads to be impassible.  ",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "This is a late season hunt. Weather on this hunt unit tends to be cold with snow conditions, but can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u> The Mule deer on the Dolores Triangle typically leave the higher elevations of Colorado during mid to late fall and head for their Utah wintering range at lower elevations. Weather conditions in Colorado highly affect how many deer migrate into Utah, and when they come. Winter range occurs throughout the unit, but deer tend to head South and West on the range.  In mid to late spring, the deer tend to follow the green-up of grasses/forbs and head back to higher elevations. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u>  Start scouting in mid-late October.  Most deer will be traveling to the Triangle at this time and you will be able to get an idea of what kind of bucks are typical on the unit.  The amount and severity of winter storms will increase the number of deer that winter on the unit, numbers can change weekly.  Early season scouting in the Glade Park area of Colorado may also give you some idea as to what kind of bucks to expect on the hunt. Once the rut starts, look for does, bucks will be around them.  Spend some time before your hunt to learn the roads and access points.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Mule Deer Rut:</u> The mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. this can be of great benefit to hunters on these late hunts.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas for the La Sal, Dolores Triangle subunit:</u>\n<br>\n\n<i>Dolores Triangle-</i> The unit is not that big. All of the mesa tops should have deer on them during these late hunts, especially if there is any accumulation of snow.  Access is almost entirely restricted to coming in from the Colorado side, through Glade Park.  Limited/seasonal access to the unit is available on the Western point of the unit, near Robert's Bottom. \n",
