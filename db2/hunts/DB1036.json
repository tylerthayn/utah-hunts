			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The Thousand Lakes unit is a general season hunt unit and is managed to provide deer hunting opportunity. The unit has some great deer habitat and is a popular place to hunt. In recent years the unit has experienced an increase in the deer population and an increase in the buck/doe ratio. Deer hunting has been good for those willing to hunt away from roads and ATV trails. Though not managed as a trophy unit, hunters have been noticing an increasing number of mature bucks. \nDeer populate the entire unit, however the highest density of deer tend to be in parts of the unit where aspen habitat is available. The southern portion of the unit is drier, and has fewer deer. \nDuring the Muzzleloader season most of the deer still tend to be in the higher elevations though some have began to move down a little. Hunter densities are not as high and the weather is often pleasant.<br>\nRemember that Capitol Reef National Park is on the eastern portion of this unit and the park is closed to hunting and ATV travel.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Be prepared for some rough roads and rocky trails. Always carry plenty of water and tell someone where you are hunting. There are some very remote areas on this unit.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for variable conditions. Check weather forecasts often.  Snow storms often occur during this hunt.  Most of the time snow will melt off within a day or so.  Be prepared for muddy or snowy road conditions.  ",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "During the Muzzleloader season deer are scattered over the entire unit. Much of the buck movement is dictated by weather conditions. Bucks tend to remain higher in elevation than does until the rut gets underway.  The table is above 11,000 ft elevation and generally most deer move off the Table by late September. Most of the deer tend to be at the intersection of the conifer/aspen habitats and the aspen/mountain brush/sage habitats. <br>\n<br>\nEvery year a few older age class bucks are taken. There is no single area that produces more than others. The key is to scout your areas before the hunt to look for the deer you want.\n<br><br>\n\n\n\n\n",
