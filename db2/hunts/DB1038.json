			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This hunt unit is managed as a trophy limited entry unit for deer and elk.  There is a Landowner Association on the unit and the private property comprises about 35% of the total acreage.  This unit encompasses pine, aspen, and open sagebrush in the higher elevations and desert scrub in lower elevation wintering habitat.  The private property is posted and a GPS showing private/public property boundaries is recommended.  Even though the unit has private property, there is still 65% public land that is huntable.  Don't expect to gain access to hunt the private property.  The average buck taken is a 24 inch 4x4.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Cellular phone coverage is spotty in the mountains on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past in this unit.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically between the hunting seasons.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable or very muddy.\n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nMule deer on this unit are typically on the top of Diamond Mountain during the muzzleloader hunt.  The top of Diamond Mountain is where the majority of the water and food is during the fall.  After the rut, mule deer will move north to Browns Park and south to the Diamond Rim and lower elevations during the winter, depending on snow depth.  The migration is mostly to either the north or south.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Scouting Tips:</u><br>\nDeer are pretty habitual until the rut starts.  Scouting trips are recommended, especially for the muzzleloader hunt.  The bigger, more mature bucks are sometimes harder to find and scouting trips are recommended if you wish to take a bigger mature buck.   A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential.  Scouting is most effective the last couple weeks before the hunt opens when they are more likely to stay in the same general area.  Deer do have areas they like and stay in but they can move if they get spooked.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Mule deer rut:</u><br>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid-November-mid-December so it does not affect this hunt.  <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas on Diamond Mountain:</u><br>\nDeer are found throughout much of the unit, depending on time of year.  During all three hunts, deer are typically found higher in elevation and haven’t moved to their wintering habitat yet, which includes Browns Park and south of Diamond Rim.  There are a lot of roads in the bottom of the draws on this unit so deer can be seen easily from vehicles.<br>\n<br>\nGood public land areas to hunt include Wild Mountain, Diamond Rim, Top of Crouse Canyon, Marshall Draw, Warren Draw, Mail Draw, and Little Hole.  Most of the ridges on this unit are public land and are accessible through public lands, although not always easily.  Most of the public land on Diamond Mountain is BLM and DWR-owned lands.",
