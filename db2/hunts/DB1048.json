			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "The majority of land is managed by the BLM and forest Service. There is also a significant amount of private land. This unit does have a Landowner Association. There is private land and some of it is accessible through the DWR’s Walk-in-Access Program (http://wildlife.utah.gov/walkinaccess/).  ",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This is a remote location with some areas with limited access.  Cellular phone coverage is very spotty on this hunt unit.  Digital cell phones may show several bars but cannot always connect due to the distance to the cell towers.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  The biologist suggests hand held radios and even a \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Thunder storms can cause muddy road conditions and rare flash floods in this region.  Most hunters struggle with trying not to get there meat to spoil in the heat.  I would plan on hot weather and plan accordingly.\n\n",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This unit is primarily the Sheeprock and Simpson Mts.. I would not spend precious time/gas (unless you something different) on Desert or Keg Mts. The average buck has been near a 24 inch/4x4. Last year the average slipped down a little but there is still good bucks out there.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Archery:</u> hunters should expect this unit to provide a spot and stalk type archery hunt. Hunter will find bucks to be high in elevation and near stream habitat. Expect dry conditions and monsoon seasons. Weather can change in a heartbeat so be prepared for a down pour. Waterholes may not be a productive hunt method if these conditions occur. Bucks will frequently change up their routine. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\nMuzzleloader:</u> hunters tend to see many bucks in the canyons the first few days. Expect mid season buck movements to change. Bucks start moving and may not be where you’ve seen them before. Keep looking. I’ve had many reports over the years that bucks are gone the second weekend. They are still there but moved to other canyons or areas. \n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\nAny Weapon:</u> hunters should expect changes in weather and possible muddy roads. This unit could experience a wide range of weather events. If it snows I would still expect bucks to remain higher in elevation. Some bucks will transition over to the south side. If the weather is bad expect bucks to be hid in brush and cover. \n<br>\n<br>\n\nThe Sheeprock and Simpson mountain ranges are remote areas in Utah.  There are few service stations. Gas is available in Vernon, Eureka, and Lynndyl. Bring plenty of water, fuel, good tires with extra spares, and plenty of ice. The west or south side is desert and dirt road. Private land holdings limit access to canyons. If you want to hunt those canyons attain permission or go over the top from the other side.\n",
