This hunt occurs during the very early part of the rut.  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<u>Recommended areas on the Beaver Unit:</u>\nThere are numerous suggested areas to hunt on this unit. \n<br>\n\nMany deer may be found on winter range during this hunt.  However, deer can be spread across the mountain and found at all elevations.\n<br>\n\nDuring the earlier hunts most of the deer on the unit are found in the habitat belt where aspen mixes with sagebrush and conifer.  That zone across the Beaver is the most productive for deer.  Every canyon across the Beaver has deer and they are of similar quality. \n<br>\n\nThe suggested areas to hunt include (starting on the west side of the unit):\n<br>\nRainbow Mine- Limited Road Access\n<br>\nCottonwood Creek- limited road access\n<br>\nCity Creek Peak - limited road access, popular area\n<br>\nLebaron Reservoir- limited road access, popular area\n<br>\nMumford Resevoir – Limited access, steep areas\n<br>\nBakers Canyon - popular area \n<br>\nBriggs Ridge – remote hunting area, steep terrain\n<br>\nShingle Creek Meadows- Some ATV trails and remote hunting opportunities.\n<br>\nNorth Creek – Limited Access\n<br>\nManderfield- gravel roads, a little flatter area, be aware of private Property\n",
