			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This unit is a General Season hunt unit and is not managed to be a trophy unit but every year a few nice bucks are taken.  There is a migration study underway to look at timing and routes of migration for North Slope deer.  We ask that collared deer are not killed.  If one is, DO NOT CUT THE COLLAR; remove the collar by loosening the lock nuts and call the number on the collar or the local biologist.  This unit encompasses lodgepole pine, open sagebrush, and desert scrub.  Hunters should expect to see other deer and elk hunters and other public land users.  This hunt coincides with a limited entry elk hunt.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "Due to recent storms, several roads in the 3 Corners vicinity have washed out and are impassable to any vehicle, including side by sides and ATVs.  Please do not harm the habitat by trying to drive off road around wash outs.  Driving off road is illegal.<br>\n<br>\nCellular phone coverage is spotty on this hunt unit.  Satellite phones do work in the area.  A \"Spot Tracker\" type of satellite messaging device for safety can be used if you decide to camp in an area without cell phone service and do not wish to drive to reach service.  Make sure someone knows where you plan to camp and when you will return.<br>\n<br>\nCamps should be kept clean to prevent bear incidents.  Food should be kept inside vehicles or bear-proof containers.  Coolers are not bear-proof.  Bears have gotten into camps in the past.  Number and severity of bear incidents differ by year depending on weather and other food availability.  Meat and garbage should be put away inside a vehicle or hung in a tree above 8 feet off the ground and 3 feet away from the trunk or any branches of the tree.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the fall.  Be prepared for rain, lightning, snow, wind and heat.  Be very cautious of lightning while hunting on high ridges or exposed slopes.  Early fall snow storms occur occasionally in this area.  Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two until through the first week of October.  Some years a big snowstorm will hit the beginning of October and make some roads impassable.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<u>Migration Patterns:</u><br>\nMule deer in the High Uintas do migrate down in elevation for the winter.  There are some deer that move from the west side of the North Slope to the east end of the North Slope for the winter.  During the winter, deer can be found down low in sagebrush flats all along the North Slope.  Most of these animals move back to higher elevations for the summer and fall, although there are some that stay in these low sagebrush flats year round.  This migration is usually after the hunt ends so it does not normally affect the general rifle hunt, unless an early snow storm pushes deer down out of the high country.  During warm, dry falls deer stay up higher longer.<br>\n<br>\n<u>Mule deer rut:</u><br>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid-November to mid-December so it does not affect this hunt. <br>\n<br>\n<u>Recommended areas in the North Slope:</u><br>\nDeer are found throughout much of the unit.  Depending on weather conditions, most of the deer on the Summit portion get pushed down into Wyoming before the Any Weapon hunt begins.  Also, high country deer are typically pushed down out of the High Country by mid-October if any early season snow storms hit.  The majority of the deer in the 3 Corners portion of the unit stay up high on Bear Mountain, Goslin Mountain, Home Mountain, and Bender Mountain until later in October/early November when deer start showing up in Browns Park for the winter.   <br>\n<br>\nThis unit is a general season unit and receives heavy hunting pressure during the regular season hunts, especially in Browns Park, Goslin Mountain, South Valley, Dowd Mountain, and along Hwy 44.  Areas with highest harvest success include Dowd Mountain, Death Valley, South Valley, Greendale Junction (along Highway 44 and 191), Red Creek Flat, Clay Basin, Goslin Mountain, and 3 Corners.  Hunters that receive written permission from private landowners in Manila also do well.  ",
