			"GENERAL_INFORMATION": "This is a pre-rut/early rut hunt that highly depends on weather factors. If weather conditions are warm and/or there hasn't yet been a substantial snow storm bucks may be found solitary or in bachelor groups still at high elevations. Snow and cool temperatures may initiate deer migration to lower elevations as well as early rut behavior with bucks being found grouped up with does in transitional mountain brush habitats or winter range. Be flexible in hunting strategies for greatest chance of success.<br>\n",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt unit can vary dramatically during the hunting season.  Be prepared for rain, snow, and cold. Early winter storms can create muddy or snowy roads and trails.",

			"HUNT_AREA_ID": 0,
			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "<b>General Considerations:</b> This is a very productive unit with both road access to high elevations and backcountry hunting opportunities.  If the weather has been mild throughout October then most hunters will find most success hunting on summer habitats at 7,500 feet and above.  If there has been a few snowstorms then deer will often begin their fall migration and hunters find success on sagebrush and mid-mountain brush type habitats.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Migration Patterns:</b>\nFall migration is very weather dependent on this unit.  Most migration occurs in late November when significant snowfall typically occurs.  However, big snowstorms in late October have prompted migration during the any weapon hunt.  When migration begins (typically in mid October to mid-December) deer move down in elevation to benches on both the east and west sides of the mountain. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Mule Deer rut:</b>\nThe mule deer rut usually runs from mid Nov.-mid Dec. but pre-rut and early rut behaviors may be observed during this hunt.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Recommended areas to hunt:</b>\nNebo Loop, Loafer Mtn, Spencer Fork, and Mona and Santaquin Benches on the north Nebo, Chicken Creek, Log Hollow, Red Ledges, and Sage Flats on the Sanpitch Mtns are good places to start looking.<br>\n<br>\n   \n<b>Scouting Tips:</b>  A good spotting scope and binoculars are essential for scouting deer. Find a high vantage point and glass a lot of terrain. If you find does with no bucks grouped up with them, keep checking on the area periodically as bucks will begin to group up with does more and more as the hunt goes on.\n",
