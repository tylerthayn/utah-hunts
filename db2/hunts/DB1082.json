If you are able to place trail cameras on the remote springs and water holes you will be able to pattern the movements of the bucks.  In the hot early fall temperatures I would expect to see the most animals at prime time (1/2 hour before dawn and an hour before sunset).  There are several recovering burned areas that have produced large amounts of edge that is excellent for deer. Deer spend a lot of time in the aspen patches where there is a good understory of grass and forbs.       \n\nThere are very few signs on the trails.  I would bring a good map, compass, GPS, and if possible someone who is familiar with the area.  If you have never set foot in this unit, it might appear small on a map but on the ground it is quite a large area.\n",
