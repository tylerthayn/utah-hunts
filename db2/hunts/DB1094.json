This hunt is primarily an agricultural area hunt. <br>\n\nHunters should be aware of the Ute Tribal Lands and learn the boundaries. Public hunting is not permitted on Tribal Lands.",
			"SAFETY_CONS": "This hunt is primarily an agricultural area hunt. Extreme caution must be used to avoid shooting toward houses, agricultural structures or livestock.",
			"WEATHER_CONS": "The weather on this hunt can vary dramatically during the hunting season. Be prepared for rain, lightening, snow, wind and heat. Fall snow storms occur regularly in this area during this hunt. Most years the snow will melt off within a day or two. Be prepared for dry or muddy conditions.",

			"BIOLOGIST_NOTES": "This hunt is intended to target mature bucks early in the rut in a private property area with high buck to doe ratios that has a high prevalence of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD).  The intent is to reduce the potential for mature bucks that may have CWD from dispersing into surrounding areas and spreading CWD.  It's been found in other states that in areas with high buck to doe ratios older bucks are more likely to disperse to sounding areas during the rut and thereby spread CWD. <br>\n\n<b>Private landowners are not required to allow public access to hunt on their property. Hunters wanting to hunt this hunt must have written permission to hunt before applying.  Obtaining permission after drawing the permit will be very difficult. </b><br>\n<br>\n",
